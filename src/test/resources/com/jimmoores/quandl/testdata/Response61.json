Full details are set out in another document (see link to 21.3. Annex, at the bottom of the page).\r\nThe following Eurostat dissemination tables are based on this data collection:\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport infrastructure (rail_if)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport equipment (rail_eq)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport - enterprises, economic performance and employment (rail_ec)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway traffic (rail_tf) but table Train movements (rail_tf_trainmv)\r\ntable Railway transport - Number of victims by type of injury (rail_ac_inj) in subsection Railway transport - Accidents (rail_ac) \r\nAdditionally, one table in the regional transport section is based on a different voluntary data collection (REGWeb questionnaire) and contains information on railway infrastructure (length of railway lines - total, electrified and with double or more tracks) by NUTS 2 regions.\r\n2. Mandatory data collection based on the legal act. Data collection on goods and passenger transport, and on rail accidents is based on Regulation EC 91/2003 from the beginning of 2003. The freight data from 1982 until 2002 are based on Directive 80/1177/EEC. Compared to the Directive, Regulation 91/2003 covers the transport of passengers and statistics on accidents in addition to the transport of goods. A detailed description of the source of each dissemination table can be found in the section 21.3 Annex (Legal acts and corresponding dissemination tables) at the bottom of this page.\n3.5.

Member States may exclude from the scope of Regulation 91/2003 (Article 2):\r\n(a) railway undertakings which operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations, including harbours;\r\n(b) railway undertakings which mainly provide local tourist services, such as preserved historical steam railways.\r\nAccording to Commission Regulation 1192/2003, 'railway undertaking' means any public or private undertaking which provides services for the transport of goods and/or passengers by rail. Undertakings whose sole business is to provide services for the transport of passengers by metro, tram and/or light rail are excluded.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/rail_pa_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-12T23:00:26Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Frail_pa_speed.sdmx.zip"},{"id":4546708,"source_code":"SNB","source_name":"Swiss National Bank","code":"BANKENCH_BBILSUM_D03_M7_16122","name":"Balance sheet total, 3 Number of institutions, by legal status: Joint-stock companies","urlize_name":"Balance-sheet-total-3-Number-of-institutions-by-legal-status-Joint-stock-companies","description":"Balance sheet total, 3 Number of institutions, by legal status, 5.11 Commercial banks (annually).
