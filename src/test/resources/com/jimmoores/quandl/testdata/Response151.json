The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nFinal consumption aggregates, including the split into household and government consumption. The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nIncome, saving and net lending / net borrowing at current prices. Disposable income is also shown in real terms.\r\nExports and imports by Member States of the EU/third countries. The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nBreakdowns of gross value added, compensation of employees, wages and salaries, operating surplus, employment (domestic scope), gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and fixed assets and other main aggregates by industry; investment by products and household final consumption expenditure by consumption purposes (COICOP). The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nAuxiliary indicators: Population and employment national data, purchasing power parities, contributions to GDP growth, labour productivity, unit labour cost and GDP per capita.\r\nGeographical entities covered are the European Union, the euro area, EU Member States, Candidate Countries, EFTA countries, US, Japan and possibly other countries on an ad-hoc basis.\r\nThe data are published:\r\n- in ECU/euro, in national currencies (including euro converted from former national currencies using the irrevocably fixed rate for all years) and in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS);\r\n- at current prices and in volume terms;\r\n- Population and employment are measured in persons.

Main indicators on \"educational attainment\" and \"transition from education to work, early leavers from education and training\"\r\nThe LFS education-related indicators on early leavers from education and training, education attainment level and young people neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET) are a collection of annual series based on the quarterly results of the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). They are published in the section 'main indicators'. The data source, EU-LFS is, where necessary, adjusted and enriched in various ways, in accordance with the specificities of an indicator, including the following:\r\n- correction of the main breaks in the LFS series,\r\n- estimation of the missing values, (i.e. in case of missing quarters, annual results and EU aggregates are estimated using adjusted quarterly national labour force survey data or interpolations of the EU Labour Force Survey data with reference to the available quarter(s))\r\nEarly leavers from education and training and tertiary educational attainment are also Europe 2020 Indicators. Early school leavers are part of the Sustainable Development Indicators.\r\n2. Detailed tables\r\nBeside these main results, LFS detailed tables are also available. The results might differ from the 'main indicators' series are the data are not adjusted as explained above.\r\n3.

Today, 46 signatory countries are engaged in the process towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental initiative which also involves the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO-CEPES, as well as representatives of higher education institutions, students, staff, employers and quality assurance agencies. It aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010, and to promote the European system of higher education worldwide. More information on the Bologna process is available on http://ec.europa.eu/education/higher-education/doc1290_en.htm.\r\nMany indicators on social dimension and mobility in the Bologna process come from the UOE data collection in the education statistics domain. The aim of the education statistics domain is to provide comparable statistics and indicators on key aspects of the education systems across Europe. The data cover participation and completion of education programmes, personnel in education and the cost and type of resources dedicated to education.\r\nThe main source of data is the joint UIS (UNESCO Institute of Statistics)/OECD/Eurostat (UOE) questionnaires on education statistics, which constitute the core database on education. Data on regional enrolments and foreign language learning are collected additionally by Eurostat. Countries provide data, coming from administrative records, on the basis of commonly agreed definitions.\r\nFrom the UOE data collection, the following datasets on the Bologna Process are available:\r\nA. Widening access\r\neduc_bo_ac_ent2: Net entry rate (ISCED 5A) by age and sex\r\neduc_bo_ac_ent3: Female entrants by field of education (ISCED 5A)\r\neduc_bo_ac_gent: Entrants at ISCED 5A and qualifying graduates of secondary schooling (ISCED 3A - 4A)\r\neduc_bo_ac_el1t: Students (ISCED 5A) studying part-time, by age \r\nB.

Student and staff mobility\r\neduc_bo_mo_el8o: Students (ISCED 5A and 6) who are nationals of a given country, studying in another country (EU-27, EFTA and CC) as % of the total enrolment in that country\r\neduc_bo_mo_el8i: Number of foreign students (world and Bologna Area) studying in a given country, as % of the total enrolment in that country, ISCED 5A and 6\r\neduc_bo_mo_gr4: Graduates (ISCED 5A and 6) from abroad (non-citizens, permanent residence and prior education outside the country)\r\nD. Effective outcomes and employability\r\neduc_bo_ou_gren: Gross graduation rate and net entry rate, ISCED 5A\r\n \r\nThe data for some countries which do not participate in the UOE data collection were provided to Eurostat specifically for the monitoring of the Bologna Process.
