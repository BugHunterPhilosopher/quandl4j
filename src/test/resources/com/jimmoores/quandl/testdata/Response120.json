The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","updated_at":"2014-01-11T18:10:09Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_FertilizersArchive_E_Africa_1.zip"},{"id":6203224,"source_code":"ILO","source_name":"International Labour Organization","code":"INJ_INJU_SEX_INJ_OCU1_RT_SEX_F_INJ_INJURY_FATAL_OCU_ISCO08_3_HUN","name":"Rate Of Fatal Or Non-fatal (with Lost Workdays) Occupational Injury By Sex And Occupation, Female, Fatal Injury, Technicians And Associate Professionals - Hungary","urlize_name":"Rate-Of-Fatal-Or-Non-fatal-with-Lost-Workdays-Occupational-Injury-By-Sex-And-Occupation-Female-Fatal-Injury-Technicians-And-Associate-Professionals-Hungary","description":"The unique tripartite structure of the ILO gives an equal voice to workers, employers and governments to ensure that the views of the social partners are closely reflected in labour standards and in shaping policies and programmes.
