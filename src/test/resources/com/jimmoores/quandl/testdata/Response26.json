The first data collection (CIS light) was launched in 1993 as a pilot exercise and the second survey (CIS2) was carried out in 1997/1998 for most of the countries except for Greece and Ireland where it was launched in 1999. The third survey (CIS3) was implemented in 2000/2001 for most of the participating countries with the exception of Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg and Greece where the survey was launched in 2002.\r\nFrom 2004 onwards, the frequency of the CIS survey has increased with a full survey carried out every four years and a reduced survey every two years after the main one.\r\nThe CIS4 was carried out in 25 Member States, Candidate Countries, Iceland and Norway; was launched in 2005, based on the reference period 2004, with the observation period 2002 to 2004.\r\nThe fifth survey CIS 2006 was carried out in 27 Member States, Candidate Countries and Norway; was launched in 2007, based on the reference period 2006, with the observation period 2004 to 2006.\r\nThe last survey CIS 2008 was carried out in 27 Member States, Candidate Countries, Norway and Iceland; was launched in 2009, based on the reference period 2008, with the observation period 2006 to 2008.\r\nIn order to ensure comparability across countries, Eurostat, in close cooperation with the EU Member States, developed a standard core questionnaire starting with CIS3 data collection, with an accompanying set of definitions and methodological recommendations. The responsibility for the survey at a national level is in most cases, with the National Statistical Office or a national Ministry.\r\nThe CIS is designed to obtain information on innovation activities within enterprises, as well as various aspects of the process such as the effects of innovation, sources of information used, costs etc.\r\nThe CIS is based on the Oslo Manual - Second edition from 1997 and third edition from 2005 - (See annex at the bottom of the page) which gives methodological guidelines and defines the innovation concept.\r\nThe changes to the CIS 2008 questionnaire were based on the requirement to meet the third revision of the Oslo Manual, 2005 edition. This was achieved by giving greater weight to organisational and marketing innovation. However, the question on innovation expenditures is still limited to product and process innovation in order to maintain continuity with earlier versions of the CIS. Furthermore, fewer questions are asked of organisational and marketing innovation than for product and process innovation.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/inn_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-13T02:01:41Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"1996-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Finn_c412.sdmx.zip"},{"id":5896644,"source_code":"ILO","source_name":"International Labour Organization","code":"EMP_XEES_ECO1_OCU1_NB_ECO_ISIC4_Q_OCU_ISCO08_8_EST","name":"Paid Employment By Economic Activity And Occupation, Human Health And Social Work Activities, Plant And Machine Operators, And Assemblers - Estonia","urlize_name":"Paid-Employment-By-Economic-Activity-And-Occupation-Human-Health-And-Social-Work-Activities-Plant-And-Machine-Operators-And-Assemblers-Estonia","description":"The unique tripartite structure of the ILO gives an equal voice to workers, employers and governments to ensure that the views of the social partners are closely reflected in labour standards and in shaping policies and programmes.
