Statistics on water and waste are based on official statistics supplied by national statistical offices and/or ministries of environment (or equivalent institutions) in countries in response to the biennial UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics. They were complemented by data on EU and OECD member and partner countries from OECD and Eurostat. Environment statistics is still in an early stage of development in many countries, and data are often sparse. The statistics selected here are those of relatively good quality and geographic coverage. The online database currently covers the years 1990, 1995 to 2009.

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","updated_at":"2014-01-10T02:25:46Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Import Quantity (Kg)"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Pesticides_Trade_E_Americas_1.zip"},{"id":7909237,"source_code":"STATNOR","source_name":"Statistics Norway","code":"1082_0_2_090","name":"Population, whole country by sex one-year age groups, pr 1.1. 1986 - - The whole country - Females - 90 years","urlize_name":"Population-whole-country-by-sex-one-year-age-groups-pr-1-1-1986-The-whole-country-Females-90-years","description":"Statistics Norway has overall responsibility for official statistics in Norway, and carries out extensive research and analysis activities.
