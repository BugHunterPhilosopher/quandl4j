The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","updated_at":"2014-01-11T18:07:44Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_FertilizersArchive_E_Asia_1.zip"},{"id":4300605,"source_code":"UN","source_name":"United Nations","code":"COMM_75_COPPERTINBASEALLOYSUNWROUGHT_REEXPORT_AUS","name":"Commodity Re-Exports - Copper And Articles Thereof / Copper-tin base alloys, unwrought - Australia","urlize_name":"Commodity-Re-Exports-Copper-And-Articles-Thereof-Copper-tin-base-alloys-unwrought-Australia","description":"The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) stores more than 1 billion trade data records from 1962.
