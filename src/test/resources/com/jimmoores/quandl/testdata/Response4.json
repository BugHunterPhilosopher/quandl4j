Variables are to be understood for the purpose of the project as qualitative questions on the subject area of the survey. The samples were drawn in participating countries from the SBS survey frame, with sample sizes up to 10.000 enterprises. Other than the NACE breakdown, a breakdown by employment size classes was applied.
