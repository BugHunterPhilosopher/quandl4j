Credit institutions are defined in Article 1 of the Council Directive 77/780/EEC: 'credit institution means an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credits for its own account'.\r\nCredit institutions are normally authorised and registered by the national central banks or by the competent national financial supervisory authority. In the frame of prudential supervision the credit institutions concerned are obliged to submit comprehensive sets of data to the supervisory authorities. The structural business statistics on credit institutions are to a large extent based on this information.\r\nThe Credstat collection includes:\r\ndemographic statistics (number of enterprises (+breakdowns), number of local units, number of branches, etc.), \r\naccounting variables,\r\nvariables by product,\r\nvariables on internationalisation,\r\nvariables on employment,\r\nregional statistics\r\n\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/sbs_cre_esms.htm","updated_at":"2013-05-17T11:22:18Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1997-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Fsbs_cre_gfinsub.sdmx.zip"}
