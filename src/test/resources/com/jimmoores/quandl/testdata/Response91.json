These population estimates and projections provide the standard and consistent set of population figures which are used throughout the United Nations system as the basis for activities requiring population information as an input. In particular, these population figures provide the \"denominators\" for the regular estimates and projections exercises undertaken by the specialized agencies in sectors such as labour force, school enrolment and agriculture. The Population Division, the regional commissions, specialized agencies and other organizations within the United Nations system that regularly make use of these estimates and projections (particularly for the preparation of the above-mentioned population-based sectoral estimates and projections) meet every two years, under the auspices of the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination (ACC), to organize work and to maintain consistency among the United Nations population and sectoral estimates and projections.A second aspect of the population estimates and projections work programme is preparation of consistent estimates and projections of the urban and rural populations for all countries and areas of the world. Estimates and projections of urban and rural populations cover the period of 1950 to 2030 and are revised biennially. Thirdly, the Population Division prepares the United Nations estimates and projections of populations of urban agglomerations and of capital cities. These urban agglomerations estimates and projections cover the period from 1950 to 2015. The full results are published in the same monograph as the urban projections.The Population Division also prepares, from time to time, supplementary world population projections, extending the regular projections into the \"long term\". The latest such projections, published in 1998, presents seven scenarios of population projections to the year 2150 for large areas of the world appeared in World Population Projections to 2150.

Today, 46 signatory countries are engaged in the process towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental initiative which also involves the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO-CEPES, as well as representatives of higher education institutions, students, staff, employers and quality assurance agencies. It aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010, and to promote the European system of higher education worldwide. More information on the Bologna process is available on http://ec.europa.eu/education/higher-education/doc1290_en.htm.\r\nIn the framework of the indicators for the monitoring of the social dimension and mobility of the Bologna Process, the EU-SILC (EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) data of interest cover individual's educational attainment, income and, from the intergenerational transmission of poverty ad hoc module, educational attainment of the parents. The following data-sets, having EU-SILC as source, on the Bologna Process are available:\r\nA. Widening access\r\neduc_bo_ac_sobs: Individuals having completed tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), according to the educational background of their parents, by sex\r\neduc_bo_ac_soba: Individuals having completed tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), according to the educational background of their parents, by age \r\nD. Effective outcomes and employability\r\neduc_bo_ou_attd: Annual gross income of workers by educational attainment (2006)\r\neduc_bo_ou_terd: Annual gross income of workers with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) , by sex (2006)\r\nThe general aim of the EU-SILC domain is to provide comparable statistics and indicators on key aspects of the citizens' living conditions across Europe.\r\nThis domain actually contains a range of social statistics and indicators relating to the risks of income poverty and social exclusion. There are both conceptual and methodological problems in defining and measuring income poverty and social exclusion. Since a 1984 decision of the European Council, the following are regarded as poor: \"those persons, families and groups of persons whose resources (material, cultural and social) are so limited as to exclude them from the minimum acceptable way of life in the Member State to which they belong\". On this basis, measures of poverty at EU level adopt an approach which is both multi-dimensional and relative. In June 2006, a new set of common indicators for the social protection and social inclusion process was adopted. (For more details and definitions of these indicators: Indicators 2006).\r\nTo investigate particular areas of policy interest in more detail, target secondary areas, to be collected every four years or less frequently, are added to the cross-sectional component of EU-SILC. \"The intergenerational transmission of poverty\" was chosen as the area to be implemented for 2005. This specific module, collected in 2005, had as purpose to collect and compile relevant and robust information on background factors linked to adult social exclusion, minimising the burden of respondents to provide accurate detailed indicators sufficiently comparable across the EU capturing the effects of childhood experiences on poverty risk.\r\nMore general information on EU-SILC is available on\r\nilc_base.htm\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/educ_bo_ac_sobs_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-11T11:46:52Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Feduc_bo_ou_mism.sdmx.zip"},{"id":3738040,"source_code":"UN","source_name":"United Nations","code":"COMM_53_PLAINWEAVECOTTON85200GM2DYED_IMPORT_VNM","name":"Commodity Imports - Cotton / Plain weave cotton, >85% >200g/m2, dyed - Viet Nam","urlize_name":"Commodity-Imports-Cotton-Plain-weave-cotton-85-200g-m2-dyed-Viet-Nam","description":"The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) stores more than 1 billion trade data records from 1962.
