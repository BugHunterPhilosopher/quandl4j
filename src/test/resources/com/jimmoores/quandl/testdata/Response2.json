Pension funds coincide, in general, with the institutions for occupational retirement provision as defined in Directive 2003/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision.\r\nAn institution for occupational retirement provision is defined as an institution, irrespective of its legal form, operating on a funded basis, established separately from any sponsoring undertaking or trade for the purpose of providing retirement benefits in the context of an occupational activity on the basis of an agreement or a contract agreed:\r\nindividually or collectively between the employer(s) and the employee(s) or their respective representatives, or\r\nwith self-employed persons, in compliance with the legislation of the ho authorised and registered by national financial supervisory authorities. In the frame of prudential supervision the pension funds are obliged to submit comprehensive sets of data to the supervisory authorities. The structural business statistics on pension funds are to a large extent based on this information. \r\naccounting variables,\r\nvariables on internationalisation,\r\nvariables on employment,\r\nvariables on the number of members\r\nMonetary data are expressed in millions of Euro/ECU, other data are in units. The exchange rates used to convert the data in national currency into euro/ECU are annual averages (See annex at the bottom of the page).\r\nStructural business statistics are based on the NACE Rev.1 classification. The product classification is based on the CPA-nomenclature.\r\nPension funds are normally authorised and registered by national financial supervisory authorities.
