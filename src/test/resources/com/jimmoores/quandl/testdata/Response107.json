The Key Economic Indicators (KEI) database contains monthly and quarterly statistics (and associated statistical methodological information) for the 33 OECD member and for a selection of non-member countries on a wide variety of economic indicators, namely: quarterly national accounts, industrial production, composite leading indicators, business tendency and consumer opinion surveys, retail trade, consumer and producer prices, hourly earnings, employment/unemployment, interest rates, monetary aggregates, exchange rates, international trade and balance of payments. Indicators have been prepared by national statistical agencies primarily to meet the requirements of users within their own country. In most instances, the indicators are compiled in accordance with international statistical guidelines and recommendations. However, national practices may depart from these guidelines, and these departures may impact on comparability between countries. There is an on-going process of review and revision of the contents of the database in order to maximise the relevance of the database for short-term economic analysis.

The transactions are for the most part between residents and non-residents of the economy. The transactions included comprise: goods, services, and income; those involving financial claims on and liabilities to the rest of the world; and transfers. A transaction is defined as an economic flow that reflects the creation, transformation, exchange, transfer, or extinction of economic value and involves changes in ownership, of goods or assets, the provision of services, labour or capital. Where the seasonal adjustment has been carried out by the OECD, the X-12 Reg-ARIMA method is used. Balance of payments statistics are used as a key economic indicator due to the close relationship between domestic economic and external developments. This relationship has strengthened over the last two decades with the growing interdependence of the world`s economies. Balance of payments and related trade and financial statistics are used by agencies responsible for the formulation of policy on issues such as causes of payments imbalances, adjustment measures, merchandise trade, trade in services, financial flows, financial stability and foreign direct investment, etc. In principle as part of a double entry accounting system the balance of payments should balance, but as the components are independently derived from (many) different sources, they do not in practice balance. The residual imbalance is described by the term ânet errors and omissions.

Eurostat publishes annual and quarterly national accounts, annual and quarterly sector accounts as well as supply, use and input-output tables, which are each presented with associated metadata.\r\nQuarterly national accounts are compiled in accordance with the European System of Accounts - ESA 1995 (Council Regulation 2223/96). Annex B of the Regulation consists of a comprehensive list of the variables calculated and their timeliness, which has been updated by Regulation (EC) NÂ° 1392/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (new ESA95 transmission programme).\r\nQuarterly national accounts comprise the main aggregates on quarterly national accounts, including: GDP and its components, employment, final consumption aggregates, income, saving and net lending/borrowing, exports and imports.
