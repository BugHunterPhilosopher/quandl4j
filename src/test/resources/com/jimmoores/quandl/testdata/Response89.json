The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","updated_at":"2014-01-13T04:12:45Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Food (tonnes)","Other Util (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_Crops_E_Europe_1.zip"},{"id":4160765,"source_code":"UN","source_name":"United Nations","code":"COMM_73_FLATROLLEDIRONORNONALLOYSTEELWIDTH600MMUNCLAD025CNE_EXPORT_GAB","name":"Commodity Exports - Iron And Steel / Flat rolled iron or non-alloy steel, width <600mm, unclad, <0.25% C, ne - Gabon","urlize_name":"Commodity-Exports-Iron-And-Steel-Flat-rolled-iron-or-non-alloy-steel-width-600mm-unclad-0-25-C-ne-Gabon","description":"The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) stores more than 1 billion trade data records from 1962.
