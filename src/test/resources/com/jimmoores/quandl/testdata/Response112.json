Today, 46 signatory countries are engaged in the process towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental initiative which also involves the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO-CEPES, as well as representatives of higher education institutions, students, staff, employers and quality assurance agencies. It aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010, and to promote the European system of higher education worldwide. More information on the Bologna process is available on http://ec.europa.eu/education/higher-education/doc1290_en.htm.\r\nMany indicators on social dimension and mobility in the Bologna process come from the UOE data collection in the education statistics domain. The aim of the education statistics domain is to provide comparable statistics and indicators on key aspects of the education systems across Europe. The data cover participation and completion of education programmes, personnel in education and the cost and type of resources dedicated to education.\r\nThe main source of data is the joint UIS (UNESCO Institute of Statistics)/OECD/Eurostat (UOE) questionnaires on education statistics, which constitute the core database on education. Data on regional enrolments and foreign language learning are collected additionally by Eurostat. Countries provide data, coming from administrative records, on the basis of commonly agreed definitions.\r\nFrom the UOE data collection, the following datasets on the Bologna Process are available:\r\nA. Widening access\r\neduc_bo_ac_ent2: Net entry rate (ISCED 5A) by age and sex\r\neduc_bo_ac_ent3: Female entrants by field of education (ISCED 5A)\r\neduc_bo_ac_gent: Entrants at ISCED 5A and qualifying graduates of secondary schooling (ISCED 3A - 4A)\r\neduc_bo_ac_el1t: Students (ISCED 5A) studying part-time, by age \r\nB. Study framework\r\neduc_bo_fi_fgdp: Public expenditure on tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), as % of GDP or total public expenditure\r\neduc_bo_fi_ftot: Annual total expenditure on educational institutions (ISCED 5-6) per full-time equivalent student with and without expenditure on research and ancillary services\r\neduc_bo_fi_ffun: Tertiary education institutions' income from private sources (households and other private entities) as % of all public and private sources\r\neduc_bo_fi_fiaid: Public financial aid to tertiary students (ISCED 5-6), by type of aid, as % of public expenditure on tertiary education\r\nC. Student and staff mobility\r\neduc_bo_mo_el8o: Students (ISCED 5A and 6) who are nationals of a given country, studying in another country (EU-27, EFTA and CC) as % of the total enrolment in that country\r\neduc_bo_mo_el8i: Number of foreign students (world and Bologna Area) studying in a given country, as % of the total enrolment in that country, ISCED 5A and 6\r\neduc_bo_mo_gr4: Graduates (ISCED 5A and 6) from abroad (non-citizens, permanent residence and prior education outside the country)\r\nD. Effective outcomes and employability\r\neduc_bo_ou_gren: Gross graduation rate and net entry rate, ISCED 5A\r\n \r\nThe data for some countries which do not participate in the UOE data collection were provided to Eurostat specifically for the monitoring of the Bologna Process. Not being fully integrated in the UOE, the data sometimes might not be as comparable as the data for the remaining countries, due to differences in the underlying data sources and definitions.

Full details are set out in another document (see link to 21.3. Annex, at the bottom of the page).\r\nThe following Eurostat dissemination tables are based on this data collection:\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport infrastructure (rail_if)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport equipment (rail_eq)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport - enterprises, economic performance and employment (rail_ec)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway traffic (rail_tf) but table Train movements (rail_tf_trainmv)\r\ntable Railway transport - Number of victims by type of injury (rail_ac_inj) in subsection Railway transport - Accidents (rail_ac) \r\nAdditionally, one table in the regional transport section is based on a different voluntary data collection (REGWeb questionnaire) and contains information on railway infrastructure (length of railway lines - total, electrified and with double or more tracks) by NUTS 2 regions.\r\n2. Mandatory data collection based on the legal act. Data collection on goods and passenger transport, and on rail accidents is based on Regulation EC 91/2003 from the beginning of 2003. The freight data from 1982 until 2002 are based on Directive 80/1177/EEC. Compared to the Directive, Regulation 91/2003 covers the transport of passengers and statistics on accidents in addition to the transport of goods. A detailed description of the source of each dissemination table can be found in the section 21.3 Annex (Legal acts and corresponding dissemination tables) at the bottom of this page.\n3.5. Statistical unit\nThe statistical units for rail transport statistics are all railway undertakings in the EEA Member States. Member States may exclude from the scope of Regulation 91/2003 (Article 2):\r\n(a) railway undertakings which operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations, including harbours;\r\n(b) railway undertakings which mainly provide local tourist services, such as preserved historical steam railways.\r\nAccording to Commission Regulation 1192/2003, 'railway undertaking' means any public or private undertaking which provides services for the transport of goods and/or passengers by rail. Undertakings whose sole business is to provide services for the transport of passengers by metro, tram and/or light rail are excluded.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/rail_pa_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-13T03:54:08Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Frail_pa_typepkm.sdmx.zip"},{"id":4284099,"source_code":"UN","source_name":"United Nations","code":"COMM_74_CONTAINERSFORCOMPRESSEDLIQUEFIEDGASIRONORSTEE_IMPORT_SEN","name":"Commodity Imports - Articles Of Iron Or Steel / Containers for compressed/liquefied gas, iron or stee - Senegal","urlize_name":"Commodity-Imports-Articles-Of-Iron-Or-Steel-Containers-for-compressed-liquefied-gas-iron-or-stee-Senegal","description":"The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) stores more than 1 billion trade data records from 1962.
