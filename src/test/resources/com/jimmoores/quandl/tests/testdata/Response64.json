A fatal accident is defined as an accident which leads to the death of a victim within one year of the accident.\r\nThe indicators used are the number and incidence rate of serious and fatal accidents at work.\r\nThe incidence rate of serious accidents at work is the number of persons involved in accidents at work with more than 3 days' absence per 100,000 persons in employment.\r\nThe incidence rate of fatal accidents at work is the number of persons with fatal accidents at work per 100,000 persons in employment.\r\nThe national ESAW sources are the declarations of accidents at work, either to the public (Social Security) or private specific insurance for accidents at work, or to other relevant national authority (Labour Inspection, etc.) for countries having a \"universal\" Social Security system. For the Netherlands only survey data are available for the non-fatal accidents at work (a special module in the national labour force survey).\r\nSector coverage:\r\nIn general the private sector is covered by all national reporting systems. However some important sectors are not covered by all Member States. The specification of sectors is given according to the NACE classification (NACE = Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne).\r\nThe incidence rate is calculated for the total of the so-called 9 common branches (See point 3.6).\r\nFor a structured metadata overview on variables, coverage of sectors and professional status please see also the annex Metadata_overview_2007.\r\nStatistical adjustments:\r\nBecause the frequency of work accidents is higher in some branches (high-risk sectors), an adjustment is performed to get more standardised incidence rates. For more details, please see the summary methodology (link at the bottom of the page).\r\nGeographical coverage:\r\nFor accidents at work, data are available for all old EU-Member States (EU 15) and Norway. The methodology has also been implemented in the New Member States and Switzerland with first data being available for the reference year 2004.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/hsw_acc7_work_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-08-21T21:35:16.886Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":10653632,"source_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission Filings","source_code":"SEC","code":"SSN_MINIMUMPERCENTAGEINCREASEONVOLUMEWEIGHTEDAVERAGESHAREPRICEINCREASEFORBONUSTOBEPAID_A","name":"Samson Oil &amp; Gas LTD  (SSN): Annual Minimum Percentage Increase On Volume Weighted Average Share Price Increase For Bonus To Be Paid","urlize_name":"Samson-Oil-amp-Gas-LTD-SSN-Annual-Minimum-Percentage-Increase-On-Volume-Weighted-Average-Share-Price-Increase-For-Bonus-To-Be-Paid","display_url":null,"description":"SEC Name: MinimumPercentageIncreaseOnVolumeWeightedAverageSharePriceIncreaseForBonusToBePaid","updated_at":"2014-03-07T06:43:13.528Z","frequency":"daily","from_date":"2011-06-30","to_date":"2011-06-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":10890786,"source_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission Filings","source_code":"SEC","code":"INTZ_OTHERACCRUEDLIABILITIESCURRENT_A","name":"INTRUSION INC  (INTZ): Annual Other Accrued Liabilities Current","urlize_name":"INTRUSION-INC-INTZ-Annual-Other-Accrued-Liabilities-Current","display_url":null,"description":"SEC Name: OtherAccruedLiabilitiesCurrent","updated_at":"2014-03-07T18:17:03.419Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":3248194,"source_name":"United Nations","source_code":"UN","code":"COMM_30_DGLUCITOLSORBITOL_IMPORT_SLV","name":"Commodity Imports - Organic Chemicals / D-glucitol (sorbitol) - El Salvador","urlize_name":"Commodity-Imports-Organic-Chemicals-D-glucitol-sorbitol-El-Salvador","display_url":"http://data.un.org/browse.aspx","description":"The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) stores more than 1 billion trade data records from 1962.
