The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","updated_at":"2014-09-18T08:01:37.222Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Feed (tonnes)","Other Util (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9959726,"source_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission Filings","source_code":"SEC","code":"ADI_ASSETSOFDISPOSALGROUPINCLUDINGDISCONTINUEDOPERATIONCURRENT_Q","name":"ANALOG DEVICES INC  (ADI): Quarterly Assets Of Disposal Group Including Discontinued Operation Current","urlize_name":"ANALOG-DEVICES-INC-ADI-Quarterly-Assets-Of-Disposal-Group-Including-Discontinued-Operation-Current","display_url":null,"description":"SEC Name: AssetsOfDisposalGroupIncludingDiscontinuedOperationCurrent","updated_at":"2014-02-19T02:33:12.580Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-11-01","to_date":"2009-10-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9959269,"source_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission Filings","source_code":"SEC","code":"ADI_MINIMUMMATURITYOFTRADEDOPTIONSUSEDTOESTIMATEVOLATILITY_A","name":"ANALOG DEVICES INC  (ADI): Annual Minimum Maturity Of Traded Options Used To Estimate Volatility","urlize_name":"ANALOG-DEVICES-INC-ADI-Annual-Minimum-Maturity-Of-Traded-Options-Used-To-Estimate-Volatility","display_url":null,"description":"SEC Name: MinimumMaturityOfTradedOptionsUsedToEstimateVolatility","updated_at":"2014-02-19T02:31:08.196Z","frequency":"daily","from_date":"2010-10-30","to_date":"2013-11-02","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9959724,"source_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission Filings","source_code":"SEC","code":"ADI_TAXEFFECTRELATEDTODEFINEDBENEFITPLANS_A","name":"ANALOG DEVICES INC  (ADI): Annual Tax Effect Related To Defined Benefit Plans","urlize_name":"ANALOG-DEVICES-INC-ADI-Annual-Tax-Effect-Related-To-Defined-Benefit-Plans","display_url":null,"description":"SEC Name: TaxEffectRelatedToDefinedBenefitPlans","updated_at":"2014-02-19T02:32:35.999Z","frequency":"daily","from_date":"2007-11-03","to_date":"2007-11-03","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9959750,"source_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission Filings","source_code":"SEC","code":"ADK_COMMONSTOCKDIVIDENDSSHARES_Q","name":"ADCARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC  (ADK): Quarterly Common Stock Dividends Shares","urlize_name":"ADCARE-HEALTH-SYSTEMS-INC-ADK-Quarterly-Common-Stock-Dividends-Shares","display_url":null,"description":"SEC Name: CommonStockDividendsShares","updated_at":"2014-02-19T02:36:52.337Z","frequency":"daily","from_date":"2012-10-22","to_date":"2012-10-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":12084165,"source_name":"U.S. Energy Information Administration Data","source_code":"EIA","code":"PET_MTTIP_R20_NAR_2_A","name":"Midwest (padd 2) Imports By Padd Of Processing From Argentina Of Crude Oil And Petroleum Products, Annual","urlize_name":"Midwest-padd-2-Imports-By-Padd-Of-Processing-From-Argentina-Of-Crude-Oil-And-Petroleum-Products-Annual","display_url":"http://api.eia.gov/series/data?api_key=EE01025CF155E957411F0BE8170D7637&series_id=PET.MTTIP_R20-NAR_2.A&out=xml","description":"Units = Thousand Barrels Per Day.
