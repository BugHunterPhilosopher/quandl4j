Actual As Reported Diluted earnings, sometimes called Generally Accepted Accounting Principal (GAAP) earnings, is income from continuing operations. It excludes both discontinued and extraordinary income. Both of these terms are defined by Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) under GAAP. As Reported earnings represent the longest monitored earnings series available today. Actual Operating Basic earnings then excludes 'unusual' items from that value. Operating income is not defined under GAAP by FASB. This permits individual companies to interpret what is and what is not 'unusual'. The result is a varied interpretation of items and charges, where the same specific type of charge may be included in Operating earnings for one company and omitted from another. S&P reviews all earnings to insure compatibility across company and industry groups.","updated_at":"2014-01-12T17:34:32.683Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Telecommunication Services"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":4893990,"source_name":"U.S. Energy Information Administration Data","source_code":"EIA","code":"ELEC_PLANT_CONS_TOT_10605_BLQ_ALL_M","name":"Fuel Consumption Quantity : Brunswick Cellulose : Black Liquour : All Primemovers : Monthly","urlize_name":"Fuel-Consumption-Quantity-Brunswick-Cellulose-Black-Liquour-All-Primemovers-Monthly","display_url":"http://api.eia.gov/series/data?api_key=EE01025CF155E957411F0BE8170D7637&series_id=ELEC.PLANT.CONS_TOT.10605-BLQ-ALL.M&out=xml","description":"Units=Tons.
