The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","updated_at":"2014-01-13T01:47:21Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip"},{"id":11369884,"source_code":"ECB","source_name":"European Central Bank","code":"GST_A_PT_N_B1300_SPR_B11U2_FB_G","name":"Portugal Shares and Other equity privatisation Corporations -NCBs General government -NCBs Financial flows at market value Percentage points, series/GDP","urlize_name":"Portugal-Shares-and-Other-equity-privatisation-Corporations-NCBs-General-government-NCBs-Financial-flows-at-market-value-Percentage-points-series-GDP","description":" Portugal - Shares and Other equity - privatisation - Corporations (ESA95)-NCBs - General government (ESA95)-NCBs - Financial flows at market value - Percentage points, series(t)/GDP(t) - Neither seasonally nor working day adjusted , :, Dataset:GST : Government Statistics Explanation page (Series and Dataset Level Information), Reference area:Portugal (PT), Decimals:Six (6), Collection indicator:Summed through period (S)","updated_at":"2014-04-26T00:53:17Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Percent"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/export.do?node=9485649&SERIES_KEY=121.GST.A.PT.N.B1300.SPR.B11U2.FB.G&exportType=sdmx"},{"id":5925468,"source_code":"ILO","source_name":"International Labour Organization","code":"EMP_XEES_SEX_ECO1_NB_SEX_T_ECO_ISIC3_L_SAU","name":"Paid Employment By Sex And Economic Activity, Total, Public Administration And Defence; Compulsory Social Security - Saudi Arabia","urlize_name":"Paid-Employment-By-Sex-And-Economic-Activity-Total-Public-Administration-And-Defence-Compulsory-Social-Security-Saudi-Arabia","description":"The unique tripartite structure of the ILO gives an equal voice to workers, employers and governments to ensure that the views of the social partners are closely reflected in labour standards and in shaping policies and programmes.
