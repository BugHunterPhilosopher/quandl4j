The quantity and quality of health care services provided and the work sharing established between the different institutions are a subject of ongoing debate in all countries. Sustainability - continuously providing the necessary monetary and personal resources needed - and meeting the challenges of ageing societies are the primary perspectives used when analysing and using the data.\r\nThe resource-related data refer to both human and technical resources, i.e. they relate to:\r\n- 'Health care staff': 'manpower' active in the health care sector (doctors, dentists, nurses, etc.);\r\n- 'Health care facilities': technical capacity dimensions (hospital beds, beds in nursing and residential care facilities, etc.).\r\nAnnual national and regional data are provided in absolute numbers and in population-standardised rates (per 100 000 inhabitants).\r\nWherever applicable, the definitions and classifications of the System of Health Accounts (SHA) are followed, e.g. International Classification for Health Accounts - Providers of health care (ICHA-HP). For hospital discharges, the International Shortlist for Hospital Morbidity Tabulation (ISHMT) is used.\r\nHealth care data on resources are largely based on administrative data sources in the countries. Therefore, they reflect the country-specific way of organising health care and may not always be completely comparable.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/hlth_res_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-08-21T20:28:01.515Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":13705978,"source_name":"Statistics Canada","source_code":"CANSIM","code":"V64544750","name":"276-0021: Employment Insurance program (EI), beneficiaries by province, total and regular income benefits, declared earnings, sex and detailed age: monthly (persons)","urlize_name":"276-0021-Employment-Insurance-program-EI-beneficiaries-by-province-total-and-regular-income-benefits-declared-earnings-sex-and-detailed-age-monthly-persons","display_url":"http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a08","description":"{\" Geography\"=>\"Canada\", \" Beneficiary detail\"=>\"All types of income benefits\", \" Sex\"=>\"Females\", \" Age group\"=>\"15 to 24 years\"}","updated_at":"2014-08-16T19:26:17.236Z","frequency":"monthly","from_date":"1995-01-31","to_date":"2014-05-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9232989,"source_name":"Bureau of Labor Statistics Key Indicators","source_code":"BLS","code":"NCU7599692877799","name":"Compensation for Miscellaneous machine operators, n.e.c. in Not able to be leveled","urlize_name":"Compensation-for-Miscellaneous-machine-operators-n-e-c-in-Not-able-to-be-leveled","display_url":"http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v1/timeseries/data/NCU7599692877799","description":"Occupation: Miscellaneous machine operators, n.e.c.; Skills: Not able to be leveled (higher level = more skill); Not Seasonally Adjusted;Source: BLS National Compensation Survey.
