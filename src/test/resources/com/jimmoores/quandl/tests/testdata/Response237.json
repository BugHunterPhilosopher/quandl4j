In the same way Google made sense of the internet web structure by aggregating and ranking link structure, our theory creates a structure of world mood by aggregating and scoring emotions.  Once identified and aggregated, our proprietary engine continually scores each emotion or attitude to determine the degree present.  This allows us to create a nuanced and detailed picture of crowd mood.","updated_at":"2014-11-10T03:16:29.040Z","frequency":"daily","from_date":"2010-01-19","to_date":"2014-11-07","column_names":["Date","Bullish","Bearish","Ratio"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9479862,"source_name":"Bureau of Labor Statistics Key Indicators","source_code":"BLS","code":"IIUMFG3273204U124","name":"Number of illness cases (thousands) for Ready-mix concrete manufacturing, Private industry, Maryland","urlize_name":"Number-of-illness-cases-thousands-for-Ready-mix-concrete-manufacturing-Private-industry-Maryland","display_url":"http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v1/timeseries/data/IIUMFG3273204U124","description":"Measure: Number of illness cases (thousands); Case type: Total recordable cases of skin disease; Industry: Ready-mix concrete manufacturing; Supersector: Manufacturing; Area: Private industry, Maryland; Not Seasonally Adjusted; Source: BLS Injuries, Illnesses and Fatalities (IIF) program.
