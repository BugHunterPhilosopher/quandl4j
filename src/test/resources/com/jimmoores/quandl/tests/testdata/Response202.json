In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources. Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:46:25.528Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1965-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6660216,"source_name":"Bureau of Economic Analysis","source_code":"BEA","code":"GMP29420_QUANTITY_FUNDSTRUSTSANDOTHERFINANCIALVEHICLES_LAKEHAVASUCITYKINGMANAZ","name":"Quantity Indexes for Real GDP: Funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles - Lake Havasu City-Kingman, AZ","urlize_name":"Quantity-Indexes-for-Real-GDP-Funds-trusts-and-other-financial-vehicles-Lake-Havasu-City-Kingman-AZ","display_url":"http://bea.gov/regional","description":"Indexes.
