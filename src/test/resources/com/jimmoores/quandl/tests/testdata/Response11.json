Production quantites of each commodity are weighted by the international commodity prices 1989-91 average and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggragate for a given year is divided by the average aggreagte for the base period 1989-91. Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are substracted from the production data to avoid double counting (I.e. once in the production data and the other in the crops or livestock produced from them): It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and non-food production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating fron within the same group are deducted. The \"international commoditiy prices\" are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These \"international prices\", expressed in so-called \"international dollars\", are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultrual sector. This method assigns a single \"price\" to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unti in which the prices are expressed has no infulence on these indices published. The agicultural production per capita has the same methodology as the total production indicator.\rWhere no official or semi-official figures are available form countries, FAO makes estimates that are included in its reports and yearbooks. The FAO indices may differ from those produced ny the countries themselves because of differences in concepts of production, coverage, weights, time reference of data, use of international prices instead of national prices converted to US dollars, and methods of calculation.","updated_at":"2014-01-13T02:14:29Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Year","Net Production Index Number (PIN) base 1989-91"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://geocompendium.grid.unep.ch/data_sets/land/data/agri_prod_index_total.htm"},{"id":3558847,"source_code":"UN","source_name":"United Nations","code":"UIS_PRIMARYEDUCATIONISCED1SURVIVALRATETOGRADE5__ALLGENDERS_CPV","name":"Primary education (ISCED 1) Survival rate to Grade 5 / All genders - Cape Verde","urlize_name":"Primary-education-ISCED-1-Survival-rate-to-Grade-5-All-genders-Cape-Verde","description":"The UIS Data Centre contains indicators and raw data on education, literacy, science, culture and communication.
