Since 2006 only annual prices has been collected. Before the statistics also includes monthly prices.\r\nWhilst the purpose of agricultural price indices is to reveal trends in the prices of individual agricultural products or product groups, the purpose of the Statistics of Absolute Agricultural Prices is ‑ above all ‑ a dual one: they are used for (1) comparisons between Member States and (2) for economic analyses. Absolute agricultural prices (especially aggregated prices) are needed for many model calculations and for the determination of price elasticities.\r\nThis means that two objectives have to be met. The first one is that absolute prices be comparable between Member States. The second one is that the products for which the prices are to be recorded be of economic relevance for the respective Member State. These objectives are not necessarily compatible and some compromise may be necessary.\r\nAlthough much progress has already been made in the harmonisation of the time series across Member States, caution must still be exercised when comparing the actual agricultural prices among Member States. Differences in the prices can still reflect methodological differences (for example different form of commercialisation of the product concerned) and not factual differences in every case in the prices themselves. Hence, the user of the data should always refer to the description of the data as provided by the target definition\r\nThe agricultural prices expressed in national currency are converted into Euro (ECU until 31.12.1998) in order to allow comparisons between Member States.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/apri_ap_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-10T04:38:42Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Ftag00069.sdmx.zip"},{"id":7831716,"source_code":"FAO","source_name":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations","code":"FAO_153NEWCALEDONIA6610AGRICULTURALAREA","name":"Resources Land: Agricultural area - New Caledonia","urlize_name":"Resources-Land-Agricultural-area-New-Caledonia","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.
