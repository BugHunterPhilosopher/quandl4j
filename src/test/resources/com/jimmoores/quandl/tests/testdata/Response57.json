The quantity and quality of health care services provided and the work sharing established between the different institutions are a subject of ongoing debate in all countries. Sustainability - continuously providing the necessary monetary and personal resources needed - and meeting the challenges of ageing societies are the primary perspectives used when analysing and using the data.\r\nThe output-related data ('activities') refer to contacts between patients and the health care system, and to the treatment thereby received. Data are available for hospital discharges of in-patients and day cases, average length of stay of in-patients and medical procedures performed in hospitals.\r\nAnnual national and regional data are provided in absolute numbers and in population-standardised rates (per 100 000 inhabitants).\r\nWherever applicable, the definitions and classifications of the System of Health Accounts (SHA) are followed, e.g. International Classification for Health Accounts - Providers of health care (ICHA-HP). For hospital discharges, the International Shortlist for Hospital Morbidity Tabulation (ISHMT) is used.\r\nHealth care data on activities are largely based on administrative data sources in the countries. Therefore, they reflect the country-specific way of organising health care and may not always be completely comparable.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/hlth_act_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-10T06:21:49Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Ftps00048.sdmx.zip"},{"id":12478537,"source_code":"ILOSTAT","source_name":"ILOSTAT Database","code":"EIP_DWAP_RT_SEX_M_AGE_AGGREGATE_YGE65_EDU_AGGREGATE_INT_Q_CAN","name":"Inactivity Rate Men Ages 65+ InIntermediate Education - Quarterly - Canada","urlize_name":"Inactivity-Rate-Men-Ages-65-InIntermediate-Education-Quarterly-Canada","description":"Numbers of person are in thousands and rates are in percentage.
