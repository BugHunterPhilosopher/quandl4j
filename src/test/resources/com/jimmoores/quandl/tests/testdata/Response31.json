Early school leavers are part of the Sustainable Development Indicators.\r\n2. Detailed tables\r\nBeside these main results, LFS detailed tables are also available. The results might differ from the 'main indicators' series are the data are not adjusted as explained above.\r\n3. Ad-hoc modules\r\nIn addition to these series, an ad-hoc module to the LFS was conducted in 2000 on the entry of young people into the labour market.
