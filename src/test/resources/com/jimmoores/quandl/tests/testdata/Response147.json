The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:28:45.499Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Food (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":1091939,"source_name":"Geo3 Data Compendium","source_code":"GEOCOMP","code":"0_7_17_119","name":"Illiteracy Rate - Ages 15 and Over (Kenya)","urlize_name":"Illiteracy-Rate-Ages-15-and-Over-Kenya","display_url":"http://geocompendium.grid.unep.ch/data_sets/socio-economic/data/illiteracy_rate.htm","description":null,"updated_at":"2014-09-10T21:46:10.651Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"1999-12-31","column_names":["Year","Percent"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":1060582,"source_name":"Geo3 Data Compendium","source_code":"GEOCOMP","code":"0_0_30_124","name":"Emissions of CH4 - Total (RIVM) (Latvia)","urlize_name":"Emissions-of-CH4-Total-RIVM-Latvia","display_url":"http://geocompendium.grid.unep.ch/data_sets/atmosphere/data/emission_ch4_total_rivm.htm","description":null,"updated_at":"2014-09-10T21:45:51.509Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"1995-12-31","column_names":["Year","Thousand Metric Tons of CH4"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":1069198,"source_name":"Geo3 Data Compendium","source_code":"GEOCOMP","code":"0_3_10_68","name":"Wind Storms - Total Affected (Eritrea)","urlize_name":"Wind-Storms-Total-Affected-Eritrea","display_url":"http://geocompendium.grid.unep.ch/data_sets/disasters/data/storms_total_affected.htm","description":null,"updated_at":"2014-09-08T23:12:58.373Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Year","Number of People"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":1070426,"source_name":"Geo3 Data Compendium","source_code":"GEOCOMP","code":"0_3_15_66","name":"Earthquakes - Killed People (El Salvador)","urlize_name":"Earthquakes-Killed-People-El-Salvador","display_url":"http://geocompendium.grid.unep.ch/data_sets/disasters/data/earthquakes_killed.htm","description":null,"updated_at":"2014-09-10T21:44:24.955Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Year","Number of People"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":1091870,"source_name":"Geo3 Data Compendium","source_code":"GEOCOMP","code":"0_7_17_9","name":"Illiteracy Rate - Ages 15 and Over (Argentina)","urlize_name":"Illiteracy-Rate-Ages-15-and-Over-Argentina","display_url":"http://geocompendium.grid.unep.ch/data_sets/socio-economic/data/illiteracy_rate.htm","description":null,"updated_at":"2014-09-08T23:14:31.085Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"1999-12-31","column_names":["Year","Percent"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":1070490,"source_name":"Geo3 Data Compendium","source_code":"GEOCOMP","code":"0_3_15_99","name":"Earthquakes - Killed People (Honduras)","urlize_name":"Earthquakes-Killed-People-Honduras","display_url":"http://geocompendium.grid.unep.ch/data_sets/disasters/data/earthquakes_killed.htm","description":null,"updated_at":"2014-09-10T21:43:02.541Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Year","Number of People"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9518071,"source_name":"World Health Organization","source_code":"WHO","code":"234_TLS","name":"Outdoor air pollution attributable deaths in children under 5 years - Timor-Leste","urlize_name":"Outdoor-air-pollution-attributable-deaths-in-children-under-5-years-Timor-Leste","display_url":"http://apps.who.int/gho/athena/data/data.csv?target=GHO/AIR_4&filter=COUNTRY:TLS;\n","description":"WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.
