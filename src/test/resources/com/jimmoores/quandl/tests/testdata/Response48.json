A fatal accident is defined as an accident which leads to the death of a victim within one year of the accident.\r\nThe indicators used are the number and incidence rate of serious and fatal accidents at work.\r\nThe incidence rate of serious accidents at work is the number of persons involved in accidents at work with more than 3 days' absence per 100,000 persons in employment.\r\nThe incidence rate of fatal accidents at work is the number of persons with fatal accidents at work per 100,000 persons in employment.\r\nThe national ESAW sources are the declarations of accidents at work, either to the public (Social Security) or private specific insurance for accidents at work, or to other relevant national authority (Labour Inspection, etc.) for countries having a \"universal\" Social Security system. For the Netherlands only survey data are available for the non-fatal accidents at work (a special module in the national labour force survey).\r\nSector coverage:\r\nIn general the private sector is covered by all national reporting systems. However some important sectors are not covered by all Member States. The specification of sectors is given according to the NACE classification (NACE = Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne).\r\nThe incidence rate is calculated for the total of the so-called 9 common branches (See point 3.6).\r\nFor a structured metadata overview on variables, coverage of sectors and professional status please see also the annex Metadata_overview_2007.\r\nStatistical adjustments:\r\nBecause the frequency of work accidents is higher in some branches (high-risk sectors), an adjustment is performed to get more standardised incidence rates. For more details, please see the summary methodology (link at the bottom of the page).\r\nGeographical coverage:\r\nFor accidents at work, data are available for all old EU-Member States (EU 15) and Norway. The methodology has also been implemented in the New Member States and Switzerland with first data being available for the reference year 2004.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/hsw_acc7_work_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-10T06:24:51Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Fhsw_aw_nbosv.sdmx.zip"},{"id":10370305,"source_code":"SEC","source_name":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","code":"NGLS_SEGMENTREPORTINGINFORMATIONCAPITALEXPENDITURES_A","name":"Targa Resources Partners LP  (NGLS): Annual Segment Reporting Information Capital Expenditures","urlize_name":"Targa-Resources-Partners-LP-NGLS-Annual-Segment-Reporting-Information-Capital-Expenditures","description":"SEC Name: SegmentReportingInformationCapitalExpenditures","updated_at":"2014-03-06T22:14:49Z","frequency":"daily","from_date":"2013-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":null},{"id":5715750,"source_code":"ILO","source_name":"International Labour Organization","code":"EAP_SEX_GEO_NB_SEX_T_GEO_COV_NAT_VUT","name":"Economically Active Population By Sex And Geographical Coverage, Total, National - Vanuatu","urlize_name":"Economically-Active-Population-By-Sex-And-Geographical-Coverage-Total-National-Vanuatu","description":"The unique tripartite structure of the ILO gives an equal voice to workers, employers and governments to ensure that the views of the social partners are closely reflected in labour standards and in shaping policies and programmes.
