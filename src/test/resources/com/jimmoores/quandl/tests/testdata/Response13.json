This survey was on the extent, scope, nature and trends of relationships between enterprises, so called inter-enterprise relationships (IER). A task force met several times to set the methodology for the survey and to agree on the coverage of 21 distinct NACE areas, in part aggregating NACE Rev. 1.1 classes, groups and divisions. Variables are to be understood for the purpose of the project as qualitative questions on the subject area of the survey. The samples were drawn in participating countries from the SBS survey frame, with sample sizes up to 10.000 enterprises. Other than the NACE breakdown, a breakdown by employment size classes was applied. While some variables (questions) allowed the selection from a predefined list, others were left to the respondents' judgment as to \"very important\", \"important\", \"less important\" etc.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/ier_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-10T06:45:36Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2003-12-31","to_date":"2003-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Fier_4.sdmx.zip"},{"id":3610124,"source_code":"UN","source_name":"United Nations","code":"COMM_40_POLYESTERSNESINPRIMARYFORMS_IMPORT_SYR","name":"Commodity Imports - Plastics And Articles Thereof / Polyesters nes, in primary forms - Syrian Arab Republic","urlize_name":"Commodity-Imports-Plastics-And-Articles-Thereof-Polyesters-nes-in-primary-forms-Syrian-Arab-Republic","description":"The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) stores more than 1 billion trade data records from 1962.
