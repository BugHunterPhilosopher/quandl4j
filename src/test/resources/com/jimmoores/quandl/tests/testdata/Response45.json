The purpose of the survey is to:\r\nExamine where there may be constraints on the availability of finance, and how those may be changing.\r\nProvide evidence on the need for finance (loans, equity and other) in the future, for example to promote growth.\r\nIdentify the sources from which businesses would wish to obtain this finance.\r\n It is important to be able to compare businesses that have shown sharp growth in recent years with those that have not; and to separate more recently formed businesses from others. As a consequence, the survey will collect information separately for \"gazelles\" (defined at page 3 below); other high-growth businesses that have been established longer than gazelles; and other businesses. Only businesses with an employment of 10-249 in 2005 and at least 10 employees in 2010 are being covered.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/acf_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-08-21T21:21:51.875Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":914605,"source_name":"EuroStat","source_code":"EUROSTAT","code":"TGS00076_84","name":"Maritime transport of freight by NUTS 2 regions  : Thousands of tonnes : Noord-Holland","urlize_name":"Maritime-transport-of-freight-by-NUTS-2-regions-Thousands-of-tonnes-Noord-Holland","display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Ftgs00076.sdmx.zip","description":"Regional data collected by Eurostat may be divided into 3 major groups, taking into account the source of the data:a) data collected directly from the countries: data on transport infrastructure, stock of the vehicles and road traffic accidents (collected previously - till 2006 - on Excel sheets) is now collected using an on-line application - REGWeb; it is a voluntary data collection; data is collected at NUTS 2, NUTS 1 and NUTS 0 (country) level;b) data calculated by Eurostat based on the data collected directly from the countries: road safety indexes (people killed by million cars and people killed by million inhabitants); Eurostat calculates them using data listed under point a) above and population data (at regional level) available in Eurostat; data at NUTS 2, NUTS 1 and NUTS 0 (country) level;c) data extracted from existing Eurostat's maritime and aviation databases: data on passenger and freight transport performance for maritime and aviation; the data is collected in the framework of legal acts (at seaport/airport level) and then extracted from Eurostat's database with aggregation to NUTS 2, NUTS 1 and NUTS 0 (country) level.\r\nEurostat also uses the road transport data collected within the scope of another legal act. The 2001 data (extracted at NUTS 3 level from the road database) were analysed mostly through transportation modelling. Currently the modelling is not carried out and the dissemination tables are not updated anymore.\r\nSeveral tables present historical data and are not updated any more due to the evolution of the data collection (changes of the legal acts). The tables which are no longer updated are marked in the list below in italics.\r\nThe regional transport statistics section contains mostly data at NUTS 2, NUTS 1 and NUTS 0 (country) level, but some contain data at NUTS 2 level only.
