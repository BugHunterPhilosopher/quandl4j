The incidence rate is the number of accidents at work per 100 000 employed workers.\r\nThe indicators used for non-accidental health problems are the percentage distribution, number, prevalence rate and relative prevalence rate of health problems (relative to the rate in the total of all participating countries, which is marked with 100). The prevalence rate is the number of people suffering from the health problem during the last 12 months per 100 000 employed workers (see the link to summary methodology at the bottom of the page).\r\nStatistical adjustments:\r\nBecause the frequency of work accidents is higher in some branches (high-risk sectors), an adjustment is performed to get more standardised incidence rates. Similarly, the prevalence rates for non-accidental health problems are standardised for economic activity and for age, as age influences importantly the prevalence of health problems. For more details, please see the link to the summary methodology at the bottom of the page.\r\nGeographical coverage:\r\nDenmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, United Kingdom.\r\nSector coverage:\r\nAll sectors of economic activity are covered. The specification of sectors is given according to the NACE classification (NACE = Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne).\r\nThe incidence and prevalence rates are calculated for the total of all branches.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/hsw_inj_pb_esms.htm","updated_at":"2013-05-08T05:00:07Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"1999-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Fhsw_ij_svinj.sdmx.zip"},{"id":5157142,"source_code":"EIA","source_name":"U.S. Energy Information Administration","code":"ELEC_PLANT_AVG_HEAT_2310_DFO_IC_Q","name":"Mmbtu Per Unit : Wahoo : Distillate Fuel Oil : Internal Combustion (diesel, Piston) Engine : Quarterly","urlize_name":"Mmbtu-Per-Unit-Wahoo-Distillate-Fuel-Oil-Internal-Combustion-diesel-Piston-Engine-Quarterly","description":"Units=Mmbtu Per Barrels.
