Mandatory data collection based on the legal act. Data collection on goods and passenger transport, and on rail accidents is based on Regulation EC 91/2003 from the beginning of 2003. The freight data from 1982 until 2002 are based on Directive 80/1177/EEC. Compared to the Directive, Regulation 91/2003 covers the transport of passengers and statistics on accidents in addition to the transport of goods. A detailed description of the source of each dissemination table can be found in the section 21.3 Annex (Legal acts and corresponding dissemination tables) at the bottom of this page.\n3.5.
