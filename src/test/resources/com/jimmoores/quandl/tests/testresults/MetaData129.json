Part of the data collected is used in the context of the eEurope i2010 initiative, which seeks to further boost efficiency throughout the economy through wider use of ICTs. As a follow-up of the 2005 Action Plan a list of benchmarking indicators has been defined in the i2010 High Level Group Benchmarking Framework.\r\nThe aim of the European ICT surveys is to collect and disseminate harmonised and comparable information on the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals and in enterprises at European level. Data for this collection are supplied directly from the surveys with no separate treatment.\r\nICT usage in enterprises \r\nThe aim of this survey is the timely provision of statistics on enterprises and the information society. This module provides a framework for the requirements in terms of coverage, duration and periodicity, subjects covered, breakdowns of data provision and any necessary pilot studies.This survey covers enterprises having their main economic activity in NACE sections as specified under section 3.3 \"Sector Coverage\" below.\r\nCoverage:\r\nThe characteristics for this domain are drawn from the specific module on e-skills in the 2007 survey. These cover among others the following subjects: \r\n-         Employment of IT/ICT specialists\r\n-         Recruitment of personnel for jobs requiring ICT skills\r\n-         Main reasons for hard-to-fill vacancies for ICT specialist jobs\r\n-         Enterprises which provided training to develop/upgrade ICT skills of their personnel\r\n-         Enterprises where external suppliers performed ICT functions\r\nBreakdowns: \r\n- by size class- by NACE heading- by region: regional breakdowns are limited to no more than three groupings.\r\n \r\nICT usage in households and by individuals\r\nThe aim of this survey is the timely provision of statistics on individuals, households and the information society. This module provides a framework for the requirements in terms of coverage, duration and periodicity, subjects covered, breakdowns of data provision and any necessary pilot studies.\r\nCoverage:\r\nThe characteristics for this domain are drawn from the specific module on e-skills (e.g. Module E in 2005 and previous questionnaires, F in 2006 questionnaires).  They cover among others the following subjects: \r\n-         Last training course on computer use\r\n-         Which computer related activities have already been carried out\r\n-         Which Internet related activities have already been carried out\r\n-         How have the skills been obtained?\r\n-         Reasons for not having taken a computer course\r\nBreakdowns: \r\n- by age group,- by gender,- by educational level,- by occupation,- by employment situation,- by degree of urbanisation,- by bandwidth (broadband, non-broadband),- by region\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/isoc_sk_esms.htm",
