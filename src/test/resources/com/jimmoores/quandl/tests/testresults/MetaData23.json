      "description": "Information on net earnings (in absolute figures) and related tax-benefit rates (in %) complements gross\u2011earnings data with respect to disposable earnings. The transition from gross to net earnings requires the deduction of income taxes and employee's social security contributions from the gross amounts and the addition of family allowances, if appropriate.\r\nThe amount of these components and therefore the ratio of net to gross earnings depend on the individual situation. A number of different family situations are considered, all referring to an average worker. Differences exist with respect to marital status (single vs. married), number of workers (only in the case of couples), number of dependent children, and level of gross earnings, expressed as a percentage of the gross earnings of an average worker (AW).Â \r\nAll the data are based on a widely acknowledged model developed by the OECD.\r\nThe collection contains, for selected situations, data for the following variables and indicators :\r\na)Â Â Â Â Â  gross and net earnings, including the transition components \"income taxes\", \"employee's social security contributions\" and \"family allowances\", if appropriate;\r\nb)Â Â Â Â Â  tax rate, defined as the income tax on gross wage earnings plus the employee's social security contributions less universal cash benefits, expressed as a percentage of gross wage earnings;\r\nc)Â Â Â Â Â  tax wedge on labour costs, defined as income tax on gross wage earnings plus the employee's and the employer's social security contributions, expressed as a percentage of the total labour costs of the earner. The total labour costs of the earner are defined as his/her gross earnings plus the employer's social security contributions plus payroll taxes (where applicable). The tax wedge on labour costs structural indicator is available only for single persons without children earning 67% of the AW.\r\nd)Â Â Â Â Â  unemployment trap, measuring the percentage of gross earnings which is taxed away through higher tax and social security contributions and the withdrawal of unemployment, and other, benefits when an unemployed person returns to employment. This structural indicator is available only for single persons without children earning 67% of the AW when in work.\r\ne)Â Â Â Â Â  low wage trap, measuring the percentage of gross earnings which is taxed away through the combined effects of income taxes, social security contributions and any withdrawal of benefits when gross earnings increase from 33% to 67% of AW. This structural indicator is available for single persons without children and one-earner couples with two children.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/earn_net_esms.htm",

      "description": "Thousands of Persons Seasonally Adjusted, The data services of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis include series that are seasonally adjusted. To make these adjustments, we use the X-12 Procedure of SAS to remove the seasonal component of the series so that non-seasonal trends can be analyzed. This procedure is based on the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on this program can be found at http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/. The seasonal moving average function used is that of the Census Bureau\u2019s X-11-ARIMA program. This includes a 3x3 moving average for the initial seasonal factors and a 3x5 moving average to calculate the final seasonal factors. The D11 function is also used to output the entire seasonally adjusted series that is displayed. For specific information on the SAS X-12 procedure, please visit their website: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/etsug/60372/HTML/default/viewer.htm#etsug_x12_sect001.htm. ",
