The OECD makes comparisons every three years when Eurostat makes them every year. The last benchmark year is 2005 and data are available in the dataset 2005 PPP Benchmark results. The next benchmark year will be 2011 and results will be released end 2013. The PPP results presented here have been calculated following a methodology agreed by Eurostat and the OECD. All detailed information can be found in the Eurostat-OECD Methodological Manual on Purchasing Power Parities. The methodology employed for CIS comparisons is closely aligned with that of Eurostat and the OECD. More info at http://stats.oecd.org/OECDStat_Metadata/ShowMetadata.ashx?Dataset=PPP2008&Lang=en.",
