The scope of these surveys is the area under all type of vines.\r\nSurveys on vineyards are used to collect information on vines and wine production in the Member States at different geographic levels (Member States and regions) and over time (follow up the changes); thus they provide basic information in framework of the common market organisation of wine.\r\nThe intermediate annual surveys  cover the area under vines of wine grape varieties in the holdings and relate to changes which have taken place in that area during the preceding wine-growing year. Information regarding the following characteristics is available:\r\n- area under vines for wine grape varieties,\r\n- area under vines grubbed or no longer cultivated,\r\n- area under vines replanted,\r\n- area under vines newly planted.\r\nAll of these are broken down according to their normal use for the production of\r\n- quality wines psr (produced in specific regions),\r\n- other wines (including wines compulsorily intended for the manufacture of certain potable spirits obtained from wine with a registered designation of origin).\r\nThe areas under vines cultivated with wine grape varieties are also broken down into yield classes based upon the potential and (optionally) effective yield per hectare (hl/ha of grape must or wine).\r\n \r\nThe basic surveys cover all holdings having a cultivated area under vines normally intended for the production for sale of grapes, grape must, wine or vegetative propagation material for vines. Information regarding the following characteristics is available for each unit:\r\n- agricultural area in use,\r\n- area under vines cultivated; broken down according to its normal production into:\r\narea under wine grape varieties (separate the quality wines produced in special regions  and the other wines),\r\narea under table grape varieties,\r\narea planted with root-stock for future grafting,\r\narea cultivated solely for production of vegetative propagation material for vines (subdivided into nurseries and parent vines for root-stock areas),\r\narea under grapes intended for drying (raisins).\r\nThe areas under vines cultivated with wine grape varieties as recorded in the basic surveys are broken down into yield classes based upon the potential and (optionally) effective yield per hectare (hl/ha of grape must or wine).\r\nData are available for different territorial breakdowns for each country (wine-growing regions).
