      "description": "The Bologna declaration was signed in 1999 by 29 European ministers responsible for higher education. Today, 46 signatory countries are engaged in the process towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental initiative which also involves the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO-CEPES, as well as representatives of higher education institutions, students, staff, employers and quality assurance agencies. It aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010, and to promote the European system of higher education worldwide. More information on the Bologna process is available on http://ec.europa.eu/education/higher-education/doc1290_en.htm.\r\nBologna indicators on tertiary education attainment, occupational mismatch and unemployment are based for most of the countries on the results of the European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). For some countries not participating in the EU-LFS data collection, data were provided by their NSI and rely upon national household surveys.\r\n \r\nThe EU-LFS is a quarterly household sample survey carried out in the Member States of the European Union, Candidate Countries and EFTA countries (except for Liechtenstein). It is the main source of information about the situation and trends on the labour market in the European Union. The EU-LFS is organised in 12 modules covering demographic background, labour status, employment characteristics of the main job, atypical work, working time, employment characteristics of the second job, previous work experience of persons not in employment, search for employment, main labour status, education and training, situation one year before the survey and income.\r\nThe survey's target population consists of all persons in private households, although the variables related to labour market are only collected for persons aged 15 years or older.\r\nFor details see Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 of 9 March 1998 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community (OJ No L 77/3).\r\nSince 1999 an inherent part of the European Union EU-LFS are the so called 'ad-hoc modules'.\r\nDetailed information regarding the survey methods, organization and comparability issues is available on the EU-LFS webpage.\r\nThe following datasets are available with indicators on tertiary education attainment, occupational mismatch and unemployment used for the monitoring of the Bologna Process namely on effective outcomes and employability:\r\neduc_bo_ou_att: Population with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), by sex and age\r\neduc_bo_ou_attf: Population with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) aged 25-39, by field of study and sex\r\neduc_bo_ou_ured: Unemployment rate of people aged 20-34, by sex and educational attainment\r\neduc_bo_ou_ursy: Unemployment rate of people with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) aged 20-34, by sex and number of years since graduation\r\neduc_bo_ou_urfi: Unemployment rate of people with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), by field of study and age\r\neduc_bo_ou_mism: People with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) aged 25-34 and employed in ISCO 1 or 2, in ISCO3, and not in ISCO 1|2|3, by sex\r\neduc_bo_ou_mifi: People aged 25-34 with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) being vertically mismatched, by field of study and sex\r\nAs regards some countries, data on tertiary education attainment, occupational mismatch and unemployment were provided outside the framework of the LFS data collection and therefore cannot be considered to be always fully comparable due to differences in the underlying data sources and definitions. This parallel collection was carried out in January 2009 with some Bologna countries that have not participated in the EU-LFS data collection. Data, as well as some metadata, were collected in Armenia (AM), Moldova (MD), Serbia (RS) and Russia (RU):\r\nArmenia (AM): (indicators educ_bo_ou_att, educ_bo_ou_ured). Data provided by the National Statistical Service. Surveys: \"LFS\" and \"ILCS\". LFS for 2007 has been conducted within the frame of ILCS with a reduced number of questions;\r\nMoldova (MD): (indicators educ_bo_ou_att, educ_bo_ou_ured, educ_bo_ou_mism). Data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics. Survey: \"LFS\";\r\nSerbia (RS): (indicators educ_bo_ou_att, educ_bo_ou_attf, educ_bo_ou_ured, educ_bo_ou_ursy, educ_bo_ou_urfi, educ_bo_ou_mism). Data provided by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia. Survey: \"LFS\";\r\nRussia (RU): (indicators educ_bo_ou_urgaed, educ_bo_ou_mism). Data provided by the Federal State Statistics Service. Survey: \"Survey on employment\".\r\n\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/educ_bo_ou_att_esms.htm",
