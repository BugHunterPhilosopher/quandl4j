However the harmonized unemployment indicators are calculated with special methods and periodidicty which justify the present page.\r\nThis page focuses on the particularities of the estimation of harmonised unemployment (including unemployment rates). Other information on 'LFS main indicators' can be found in the respective ESMS page, see link in section 21.2. General information on the EU-LFS can be found in the ESMS page for 'Employment and unemployment (LFS)'. Detailed information regarding the survey methods, organization and comparability issues is available on the EU-LFS webpage.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/une_esms.htm",

In the same way Google made sense of the internet web structure by aggregating and ranking link structure, our theory creates a structure of world mood by aggregating and scoring emotions.  Once identified and aggregated, our proprietary engine continually scores each emotion or attitude to determine the degree present.  This allows us to create a nuanced and detailed picture of crowd mood.",
