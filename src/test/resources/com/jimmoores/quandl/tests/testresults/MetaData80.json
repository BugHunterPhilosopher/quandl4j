This legislation has come into force on 1 January 2007.

For this reason, only time series with good data compatibility between the old and the new legislation are shown in this domain.\r\nAccording to the current Regulation, Member States where the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds one million tons have to transmit the requested information. Member States where there is no international or transit inland waterways transport but where the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds one million tons have to transmit a reduced amount of data.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/iww_go_esms.htm",

      "description": "The absolute prices on agricultural products show prices on main agricultural outputs and inputs. Since 2006 only annual prices has been collected. Before the statistics also includes monthly prices.\r\nWhilst the purpose of agricultural price indices is to reveal trends in the prices of individual agricultural products or product groups, the purpose of the Statistics of Absolute Agricultural Prices is \u2011 above all \u2011 a dual one: they are used for (1) comparisons between Member States and (2) for economic analyses. Absolute agricultural prices (especially aggregated prices) are needed for many model calculations and for the determination of price elasticities.\r\nThis means that two objectives have to be met. The first one is that absolute prices be comparable between Member States. The second one is that the products for which the prices are to be recorded be of economic relevance for the respective Member State. These objectives are not necessarily compatible and some compromise may be necessary.\r\nAlthough much progress has already been made in the harmonisation of the time series across Member States, caution must still be exercised when comparing the actual agricultural prices among Member States. Differences in the prices can still reflect methodological differences (for example different form of commercialisation of the product concerned) and not factual differences in every case in the prices themselves. Hence, the user of the data should always refer to the description of the data as provided by the target definition\r\nThe agricultural prices expressed in national currency are converted into Euro (ECU until 31.12.1998) in order to allow comparisons between Member States.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/apri_ap_esms.htm",

      "description": "There are three categories of LFS results:\r\n1. Main indicators on \"educational attainment\" and \"transition from education to work, early leavers from education and training\"\r\nThe LFS education-related indicators on early leavers from education and training, education attainment level and young people neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET) are a collection of annual series based on the quarterly results of the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). They are published in the section 'main indicators'. The data source, EU-LFS is, where necessary, adjusted and enriched in various ways, in accordance with the specificities of an indicator, including the following:\r\n- correction of the main breaks in the LFS series,\r\n- estimation of the missing values, (i.e. in case of missing quarters, annual results and EU aggregates are estimated using adjusted quarterly national labour force survey data or interpolations of the EU Labour Force Survey data with reference to the available quarter(s))\r\nEarly leavers from education and training and tertiary educational attainment are also Europe 2020 Indicators. Early school leavers are part of the Sustainable Development Indicators.\r\n2. Detailed tables\r\nBeside these main results, LFS detailed tables are also available. The results might differ from the 'main indicators' series are the data are not adjusted as explained above.\r\n3. Ad-hoc modules\r\nIn addition to these series, an ad-hoc module to the LFS was conducted in 2000 on the entry of young people into the labour market. Similar data have been collected in a 2009 ad-hoc module to the LFS (publication foreseen in the 4th quarter of 2011). \nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/edat_esms.htm",
