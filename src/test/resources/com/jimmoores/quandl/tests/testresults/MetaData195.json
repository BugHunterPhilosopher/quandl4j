      "description": "The indicator 'average exit age from the labour force' gives the average age of withdrawal from labour market. While based on European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) data, the indicator is calculated with special methods and periodidicty which justify the present page.\r\nThe indicator is estimated with a probabilistic model, documented below, fed with data from the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). The input data are activity rates by single age group.\r\nThe indicator of 'Average exit age from the labour market' is published in the section 'LFS main indicators', which is a collection of the main statistics on the labour market. 'Population in jobless households' is also a Structural Indicator and a Sustainable Development Indicator.\r\nThere are mainly two reasons to estimate the indicator with this probabilistic model instead of using a method based on self-reported retirement age, or based on people receiving pensions benefits:\r\n1. EU-LFS data used follows definitions of employment and unemployment after the International Labour Organisation, as opposed to the notion of \"being retired\". There is no internationally harmonized statistical definition of retirement.\r\n2. The method used allows to (indirectly) count definitive exits from the labour market. Instead, a retired person could potentially decide to return to the labour market, hence his/her exit would not be definitive.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/lfsi_exi_a_esms.htm",
