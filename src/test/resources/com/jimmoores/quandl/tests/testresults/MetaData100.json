Eurostat publishes annual and quarterly national accounts, annual and quarterly sector accounts as well as supply, use and input-output tables, which are each presented with associated metadata.\r\nAnnual national accounts are compiled in accordance with the European System of Accounts - ESA 1995 (Council Regulation 2223/96). Annex B of the Regulation consists of a comprehensive list of the variables to be transmitted for Community purposes within specified time limits. This transmission programme has been updated by Regulation (EC) N° 1392/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The domain consists of the following collections:\r\nGDP and main aggregates. The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nFinal consumption aggregates, including the split into household and government consumption. The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nIncome, saving and net lending / net borrowing at current prices. Disposable income is also shown in real terms.\r\nExports and imports by Member States of the EU/third countries. The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nBreakdowns of gross value added, compensation of employees, wages and salaries, operating surplus, employment (domestic scope), gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and fixed assets and other main aggregates by industry; investment by products and household final consumption expenditure by consumption purposes (COICOP). The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nAuxiliary indicators: Population and employment national data, purchasing power parities, contributions to GDP growth, labour productivity, unit labour cost and GDP per capita.\r\nGeographical entities covered are the European Union, the euro area, EU Member States, Candidate Countries, EFTA countries, US, Japan and possibly other countries on an ad-hoc basis.\r\nThe data are published:\r\n- in ECU/euro, in national currencies (including euro converted from former national currencies using the irrevocably fixed rate for all years) and in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS);\r\n- at current prices and in volume terms;\r\n- Population and employment are measured in persons.
