      "description": "\r\n\r\nNational accounts are a coherent and consistent set of macroeconomic indicators, which provide an overall picture of the economic situation and are largely used for economic analysis and forecasting, policy design and policy making. Eurostat publishes annual and quarterly national accounts, annual and quarterly sector accounts as well as supply, use and input-output tables, which are each presented with associated metadata.\r\nQuarterly national accounts are compiled in accordance with the European System of Accounts - ESA 1995 (Council Regulation 2223/96). Annex B of the Regulation consists of a comprehensive list of the variables calculated and their timeliness, which has been updated by Regulation (EC) N° 1392/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (new ESA95 transmission programme).\r\nQuarterly national accounts comprise the main aggregates on quarterly national accounts, including: GDP and its components, employment, final consumption aggregates, income, saving and net lending/borrowing, exports and imports. Breakdowns exist for certain variables by economic activity (industries), investment products and final consumption purpose (COICOP).\r\nThe domain consists of the following collections:\r\nGDP and main aggregates. The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nFinal consumption aggregates, including the split into household and government consumption. The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nIncome, saving and net lending / net borrowing at current prices. Disposable income is also shown in real terms.\r\nExports and imports by Member States of the EU/third countries. The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nBreakdowns of gross value added, compensation of employees, wages and salaries, operating surplus and employment (domestic scope) by 6 and 17 branches; gross fixed capital formation by 6 asset types and household final consumption expenditure by consumption purposes (COICOP). The data are recorded at current and constant prices and include the corresponding implicit price indices.\r\nAuxiliary indicators: Population and employment (national) data, contributions to GDP growth, labour productivity, unit labour cost and GDP per capita.\r\nThe geographical entities covered are the European Union, the euro area, EU Member States, Candidate Countries, EFTA countries, US and Japan, and possibly other countries on an ad-hoc basis.\r\nThe data are published:\r\nin ECU/euro and in national currencies;\r\nat current prices and in volume terms;\r\nPopulation and employment are measured in persons. Employment is also measured in total hours worked.\r\nUnadjusted (NSA) and seasonally adjusted (SA). For some countries, the seasonal adjustment includes a working day correction.\r\nData sources: National Statistical Institutes\r\n\r\n\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/namq_esms.htm",
