      "description": "The domain EUROFARM (ef) contains information (statistical tables) on structure of agricultural holdings collected through agricultural structure surveys.\r\nThe data of the domain have been organised into two collections:\r\nResults of the farm structure surveys contains data from 1990 onwards\r\nStandard Gross Margin (SGM) and Standard Output (SO) coefficients.\r\nFarm Structure Survey data are used to collect information on agricultural holdings in the Member States at different geographic levels (Member States, regions, districts) and over periods (follow up the changes in agricultural sector), thus provide a base for decision making in the Common Agricultural Policy.\r\nTwo kinds of Farm Structure Survey (FSS) are carried out by Member States:\r\na basic survey (full scope Agricultural Census - AC) every 10 years,\r\nseveral sample based intermediate surveys between them.\r\nHowever for certain characteristics the Member States may use sample base for every survey.\r\nThe calendar for the surveys to be held in all Member States is agreed by the Agricultural Statistics Committee of the European Commission. For a given survey year, Member States have to conduct their surveys within the agreed time-frame, thus all the data are as comparable as possible.\r\nThe FSS are organised in all Member States on a harmonised base. Whereas the characteristics are based on community legislation, the same data are available for all countries in case of each survey. The variables are arranged into four groups:\r\none general overview with the key variables,\r\nand three specialized ones containing detailed data on\r\nland use\r\nlivestock\r\nspecial interest topics: farm labour force, rural development issues as well as management and practices.\r\nThe scope of the survey is agriculture, while the survey unit is the agricultural holding.\r\nThe data on individual agricultural holdings are collected by all Member States and sent to Eurostat. The aggregated results are disseminated through statistical tables.\r\nData for basic surveys are available in a three-level geographical breakdown of the whole country, the regions and the district; while data for intermediate surveys are only available upon the two-levels of country and regions. Since FSS 1999/2000 information about local farm location is collected in most countries, so that the data can also be disseminated by NUTS and are robust regarding the changes in the NUTS definition. The FSS 2009/2010 information is inline with the NUTS 2010 classification: Regulation (EU) No 31/2001 amending the NUTS classification from January 2012. \r\nThe Eurofarm domain does not cover the whole territory. So the land use data without link with other farm characteristics should be downloaded by the user from the relevant domain. Specific national data about rearing structure or agricultural labour force can be found in other domains, without link between the various productions at farm level.\r\nFor a comprehensive description of the domain, please consult detailed structure (See annex at the bottom of the page).\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/ef_esms.htm",
