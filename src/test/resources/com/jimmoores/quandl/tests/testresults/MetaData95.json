Our sentiment engine is designed specifically with the goal of measuring the attitudes \"bullishness\" and \"bearishness\".  We look for the granular expressions individuals add to the online conversation, on Twitter, StockTwits and chat rooms.  Our distinct and studied theory is to aggregate millions of expressions.  In the same way Google made sense of the internet web structure by aggregating and ranking link structure, our theory creates a structure of world mood by aggregating and scoring emotions.  Once identified and aggregated, our proprietary engine continually scores each emotion or attitude to determine the degree present.  This allows us to create a nuanced and detailed picture of crowd mood.",
