      "description": "CVTS2 and CVTS3 data were collected with reference year 1 1999 and 2005 and published by Eurostat in order to:\r\nProvide the Commission with harmonised, reliable and relevant statistical information needed to define, implement, monitor and evaluate Commission policies in the continuing vocational training in enterprises sector.\r\nProvide the EU institutions, national administrations, enterprises, professional associations and EU citizens with high quality statistical services and products in the field of training.\r\nCVTS3 provides comparable statistics on training enterprises, the participation to training, the volume of CVT courses and its costs, and moreover information on Initial vocational training (IVT) courses.\r\nCVTS2 provides comparable statistical results on training and non-training enterprises, the supply of and the demand for vocational skills, the need for CVT and the forms, content and volume of CVT, the use of enterprises' own training resources and of external providers, and the cost of CVT courses.\r\nThe CVTS1 was the first survey on continuing vocational training in enterprises carried out on the EU level in a co-ordinated form (outline questionnaire, common definitions, and common recommendations with the respect to the fieldwork). The survey therefore was of pioneering nature, and is not any longer disseminated.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/trng_cvts_esms.htm",

The statistics on enterprise turnover by product permits analyses on each product's relative importance in the turnover, consistency of product level statistics and product specialisation. On the other hand, information on enterprise turnover by client enables analyses on type and location of client and client specialisation. The economic variables make it possible to extend the analysis to productivity and personnel cost issues.\r\nThe bus serv collection includes the following variables:\r\nnumber of enterprises \r\nturnover or gross premium written\r\nnumber of employees \r\npersonnel costs\r\nvalue added at factor costs\r\nThe turnover variable is broken down by product and type and residence of client. In addition, there is information on the turnover shares of product and client specialised enterprises.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/bs_esms.htm",
