This data is sourced from www.opendataforafrica.org where it is offered under an open data licence (www.opendataforafrica.org/legal/termsofuse).  Net lending (+)/ borrowing (?) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core GFS balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (GFSM 2001, paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (?) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.  Source: Ministry of Finance Latest actual data: 2012/13 Notes: All fiscal and debt series data in WEO are on fiscal year basis. Fiscal assumptions: Based on policies to be implemented under the EFF Start/end months of reporting year: April/March GFS Manual used: 1986. Public Bodies also  report in 1986 format.
