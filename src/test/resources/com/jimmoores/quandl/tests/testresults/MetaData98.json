Data are collected using the Common Questionnaire of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), Eurostat and the International Transport Forum (ITF). Full details are set out in another document (see link to 21.3. Annex, at the bottom of the page).\r\nThe following Eurostat dissemination tables are based on this data collection:\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport infrastructure (rail_if)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport equipment (rail_eq)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway transport - enterprises, economic performance and employment (rail_ec)\r\nall tables in subsection: Railway traffic (rail_tf) but table Train movements (rail_tf_trainmv)\r\ntable Railway transport - Number of victims by type of injury (rail_ac_inj) in subsection Railway transport - Accidents (rail_ac) \r\nAdditionally, one table in the regional transport section is based on a different voluntary data collection (REGWeb questionnaire) and contains information on railway infrastructure (length of railway lines - total, electrified and with double or more tracks) by NUTS 2 regions.\r\n2. Mandatory data collection based on the legal act. Data collection on goods and passenger transport, and on rail accidents is based on Regulation EC 91/2003 from the beginning of 2003. The freight data from 1982 until 2002 are based on Directive 80/1177/EEC. Compared to the Directive, Regulation 91/2003 covers the transport of passengers and statistics on accidents in addition to the transport of goods. A detailed description of the source of each dissemination table can be found in the section 21.3 Annex (Legal acts and corresponding dissemination tables) at the bottom of this page.\r\nCould you please specify the name of the document you refer to?\r\nThe documents listed in the annex have been taken from the ESMS page 'rail_pa_esms'.

Our sentiment engine is designed specifically with the goal of measuring the attitudes \"bullishness\" and \"bearishness\".  We look for the granular expressions individuals add to the online conversation, on Twitter, StockTwits and chat rooms.  Our distinct and studied theory is to aggregate millions of expressions.  In the same way Google made sense of the internet web structure by aggregating and ranking link structure, our theory creates a structure of world mood by aggregating and scoring emotions.  Once identified and aggregated, our proprietary engine continually scores each emotion or attitude to determine the degree present.  This allows us to create a nuanced and detailed picture of crowd mood.",
