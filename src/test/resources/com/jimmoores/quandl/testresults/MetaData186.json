This legislation has come into force on 1 January 2007.

For this reason, only time series with good data compatibility between the old and the new legislation are shown in this domain.\r\nAccording to the current Regulation, Member States where the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds one million tons have to transmit the requested information. Member States where there is no international or transit inland waterways transport but where the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds one million tons have to transmit a reduced amount of data.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/iww_go_esms.htm",
