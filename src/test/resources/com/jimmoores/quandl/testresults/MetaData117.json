      "description": "U.S.=100 Not Seasonally Adjusted, Price Level of GDP is the PPP over GDP divided by the exchange rate times 100. The PPP of GDP or any component is the national currency value divided by the real value in international dollars. The PPP and the exchange rate are both expressed as national currency units per US dollar.The value of price level of GDP for the United States is made equal to 100. Price Levels of the components Consumption, Investment, and Government are derived in the same way as the price level of GDP. While the U.S. = 100 over GDP, this is not true for the component shares. The purchasing power parity in domestic currency per $US for GDP or any component, may be obtained by dividing the price level by 100 and multiplying by the Exchange Rate.
