      "description": "Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors are the net disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) or official aid from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region.

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.",

The purpose of the survey is to:\r\nExamine where there may be constraints on the availability of finance, and how those may be changing.\r\nProvide evidence on the need for finance (loans, equity and other) in the future, for example to promote growth.\r\nIdentify the sources from which businesses would wish to obtain this finance.\r\n It is important to be able to compare businesses that have shown sharp growth in recent years with those that have not; and to separate more recently formed businesses from others. As a consequence, the survey will collect information separately for \"gazelles\" (defined at page 3 below); other high-growth businesses that have been established longer than gazelles; and other businesses. Only businesses with an employment of 10-249 in 2005 and at least 10 employees in 2010 are being covered.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/acf_esms.htm",
