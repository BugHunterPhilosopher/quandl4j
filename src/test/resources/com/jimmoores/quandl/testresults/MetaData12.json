Those spots were selected from a standard 2 km grid with in total around 1 million points all over the EU. The land cover and the visible land use were classified according to the harmonized LUCAS land cover and land use nomenclatures. The aim of the LUCAS survey is to gather harmonised information on land use/cover and their changes over time. In addition the survey provides territorial information facilitating the analysis of the interactions between agriculture, environment and countryside (such as irrigation, land management ect.).\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/lan_esms.htm",

In addition there are tables on visible animal grazing, irrigation, forest species and landscape features. The data have been collected throug the LUCAS survey in spring-autums 2009. The statistics are presented at NUTS0, NUTS1 and NUTS 2 levels.\r\nLUCAS Survey 2009 -  Informative content\r\nLUCAS is the acronim of Land Use and Cover Area frame Survey.  In the LUCAS survey  235 000 points were visited by 500 field surveyors on the spot. Those spots were selected from a standard 2 km grid with in total around 1 million points all over the EU. The land cover and the visible land use were classified according to the harmonized LUCAS land cover and land use nomenclatures. The aim of the LUCAS survey is to gather harmonised information on land use/cover and their changes over time. In addition the survey provides territorial information facilitating the analysis of the interactions between agriculture, environment and countryside (such as irrigation, land management ect.).\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/lan_esms.htm",

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.",
