If more than one assignee (owner entity) was declared at the time of grant, the patent is attributed to the first-named assignee. The U.S. and Foreign Corporations ownership categories count predominantly corporate patents; however, patents assigned to other organizations such as small businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, etc. are also included in this category. While U.S. Government patent ownership includes only patents granted to the Federal Government, no such distinction is made for Foreign Government ownership patents. Please note that U.S. origin patents may have foreign category ownership and that foreign origin patents may have U.S. category ownership. Therefore, the patents having U.S.category ownership (or foreign category ownership) do not necessarily correspond to the patents having U.S. origin (or foreign origin) and the sum of U.S. category ownership patents (or foreign category ownership patents) will not equal the sum of U.S. origin patents (or foreign origin patents).",
