      "description": "'Statistics on high-tech industry and knowledge-intensive services' (sometimes referred to as simply 'high-tech statistics') comprise economic, employment and Science, technology and innovation (STI) data describing manufacturing and services industries broken down by technological intensity. The domain uses various other domains and sources mainly within Eurostat's official statistics (CIS, COMEXT, HRST, LFS, SBS, SES, PAT and R&D). Its coverage is therefore dependent on these other primary sources. Two main approaches are used in the domain to identify technology-intensity: the sectoral approach and the product approach. A third approach is used for data on high-tech and biotechnology patents aggregated on the basis of the International Patent Classification.  (See summary table under 21.3 for which approach is used by each type of data.)\r\nThe sectoral approach:The sectoral approach is an aggregation of the manufacturing industries according to technological intensity (R&D expenditure/value added) and based on the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) at 3-digit level. The level of R&D intensity served as a criterion of classification of economic sectors into high-technology, medium high-technology, medium low-technology and low-technology industries. In some cases, due to restrictions of the data sources used, the aggregations are made at NACE 2-digit level.\r\nServices are mainly aggregated into knowledge-intensive services (KIS) and less knowledge-intensive services (LKIS) based on the share of tertiary educated persons at NACE 2-digit level.\r\nThe sectoral approach is used for all indicators except data on high-tech trade and patents. Note that due to the revision of the NACE from NACE Rev. 1.1 to NACE Rev. 2 the definition of high-technology industries and knowledge-intensive services changed. For high-tech statistics it means that two different definitions (one according NACE Rev. 1.1 and one according NACE Rev. 2) are used in parallel and the data according to both NACE versions are presented in separated tables depending on the data availability. For example as the LFS provided the results both by NACE Rev. 1.1 and NACE Rev. 2, all the table using this source have been duplicated to present the results by NACE Rev. 2 from 2008. For more details, see both definitions of high-tech sectors under 21.3.\r\nWithin the sectoral approach, a second classification has been created - Knowledge Intensive Activities - based on the share of tertiary educated people in each sectors of industries and services according to NACE at 2-digit level and for all EU 27 Member States. A threshold was then applied to rank sectors as knowledge intensive. In contrast to first sectoral approach mixing two methodologies one for manufacturing industries and one for services, the KIA classification is based on one methodology for all the sectors of industries and services.\r\nThe aggregations in use are total Knowledge Intensive Activities (KIA) and Knowledge Intensive Activities in Business Industries (KIABI). Note that due to revision of the NACE Rev.1.1 to NACE Rev. 2 the list of  Knowledge Intensive Activities has changed as well. The two definitions are used in parallel and the data according both NACE versions are shown in two separate tables. NACE Rev.2 collection includes data starting from 2008 reference year. For more details please see the definitions under 21.3.\r\nThe product approach:The product approach was devised to complement the sectoral approach. It opens the way to far more detailed analysis of trade. The product list is based on the calculations of R&D intensity by groups of products (R&D expenditure/total sales). The groups classified as high-technology products are aggregated on the basis of the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). \r\nThe product approach is used for data on high-tech trade. Due to the revision of the SITC from SITC Rev. 3 to SITC Rev. 4 the definition of high-tech products has changed as well. The primary data source, COMEXT, has already implemented the new SITC Rev. 4. Two data collections are now available in high-tech domain for high-tech products: one by SITC Rev. 3 from 1995 to 2006 and second by SITC Rev. 4 from 2007.  For more details, see definition of high-tech products under 21.3.\r\nHigh-tech patents are defined according to another approach. The groups classified as high-tech patents are aggregated on the basis of the International Patent Classification (IPC 8th edition). Biotechnology patents are also aggregated on the basis of the IPC 8th edition. For more details, see the aggregation list of high-tech and biotechnology patents under 21.3.\r\nThe high-tech domain also comprises the sub-domain Venture Capital Investments. Data are provided by the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (EVCA). More details will be available in the Eurostat metadata specifically for Venture Capital Investments\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/htec_esms.htm",
