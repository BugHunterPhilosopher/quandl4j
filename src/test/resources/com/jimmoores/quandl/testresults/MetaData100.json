This survey was on the extent, scope, nature and trends of relationships between enterprises, so called inter-enterprise relationships (IER). A task force met several times to set the methodology for the survey and to agree on the coverage of 21 distinct NACE areas, in part aggregating NACE Rev. 1.1 classes, groups and divisions. Variables are to be understood for the purpose of the project as qualitative questions on the subject area of the survey. The samples were drawn in participating countries from the SBS survey frame, with sample sizes up to 10.000 enterprises. Other than the NACE breakdown, a breakdown by employment size classes was applied. While some variables (questions) allowed the selection from a predefined list, others were left to the respondents' judgment as to \"very important\", \"important\", \"less important\" etc.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/ier_esms.htm",

For detail information about the differences between the two versions of the NABS please refer to: Comparison between NABS 2007 and NABS 1992 (See annex at the bottom of the page).\r\nThe NABS 2007 chapter level covers (See annex at the bottom of the page):\r\nChapter 1- Exploration and exploitation of the earth\r\nChapter 2- Environment\r\nChapter 3- Exploration and exploitation of space\r\nChapter 4- Transport, telecommunication and other infrastructures\r\nChapter 5- Energy\r\nChapter 6- Industrial production and technology\r\nChapter 7- Health\r\nChapter 8- Agriculture\r\nChapter 9- Education\r\nChapter 10- Culture, recreation, religion and mass media\r\nChapter 11- Political and social systems, structures and processes\r\nChapter 12 -General advancement of knowledge: R&D financed from general university funds (GUF)\r\nChapter 13 - General advancement of knowledge: R&D financed from other sources than GUF \r\nChapter 14 - Defence\r\nBesides GBAORD in basic unit National currency (MIO_NAC) the following units are available: Euro (MIO_EUR), Euro per inhabitant (EUR_HAB) Purchasing Power Standard (MIO_PPS), Purchasing Power Standard at 2000 prices (MIO_PPS_KP00), Purchasing Power Standard per inhabitant at constant 2000 prices (PPS_KP00_HAB), Percentage of GDP (PC_GDP), Percentage of total (PC_TOT - for the breakdown by socio-economic objectives).\r\nMore details on breakdowns, derivations and different units available are found in the Eurostat indicators on GBAORD (See annex at the bottom of the page).\r\nGBAORD data are available for following countries and country groups:\r\n- All EU Member States, plus Candidate Countries, EFTA Countries, the Russian Federation, Japan, the United States and South Korea.\r\n- Country groups: EU-27, EU-15 and EA-16.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/gba_esms.htm",
