It concerns detailed data by sex, age and other characteristics for the demographic events of the previous year and the population on 1 January of the current and previous years.\r\nMore specifically, for a questionnaire sent in year T the following data is requested:\r\n- Population tables:\r\npopulation by age and sex on 1 January of years (T-1) and T;\r\npopulation by age, sex and legal marital status on 1 January of years (T-1) and T;\r\n- Fertility tables: with reference to year (T-1),\r\nlive births by mother's age, year of birth and legal marital status;\r\nlive births by biological order and mother's age and year of birth;\r\nlive births by month;\r\ntotal fertility rate and mean age at childbearing;\r\nlegally induced abortions by mother's age and number of previous live births;\r\nlate fœtal deaths by mother's age.\r\n- Mortality tables: with reference to year (T-1),\r\ninfant mortality by age and sex;\r\ndeaths by age, year of birth and sex;\r\ndeaths by month;\r\nlife expectancy at birth by sex.\r\n- Nuptiality tables: with reference to year (T-1),\r\nmarriages by previous marital status of bride and groom;\r\nfirst marriages by age, year of birth and sex;\r\ndivorces by duration of marriage.\r\n3) Nowcast: carried out in October-November (deadline 15 November of year T); this data collection aims at collecting the latest monthly data for the current year T on\r\nbirths,\r\ndeaths,\r\nimmigrants and emigrants\r\nin order to produce a 1st January population forecast for the following year (T+1).\r\n4) Regional: carried out in November-December (deadline 15 December of year T), it is based on a regional breakdown of the countries agreed at EU level using the latest version of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) and of the Statistical regions for the EFTA and Candidate countries. Detailed data are collected at regional level NUTS 2 by sex, age and year of birth, on demographic events of the previous year and on population on 1 January of the current and previous year. Aggregated data are collected at NUTS 3 level.\r\nMore specifically, for a questionnaire sent in year T the following data is requested:\r\nNUTS2:\r\npopulation by sex and age on 1st January of years (T-1) and T;\r\nWith reference to year (T-1):\r\nlive births by age and year of birth of the mother;\r\ndeaths by sex and age and year of birth;\r\ninternal migration by sex and region of origin and destination (excluding intra-regional migration);\r\narrivals due to internal migration by sex and year of birth (excluding intra-regional migration);\r\ndepartures due to internal migration by sex and year of birth (excluding intra-regional migration).\r\nNUTS3:\r\nsurface in km2 on 1st January (total surface including inland water; land area) of year T;\r\npopulation by sex and broad age groups on 1st of January of years (T-1) and T;\r\ntotal number of births and deaths in year (T-1).\r\nThe data coming from the NSIs are validated by Eurostat, processed and loaded into NewCronos (Eurostat's free dissemination website). They are also the basis of the several thematic and horizontal Eurostat publications.\r\nData are presented by single country and for aggregates of countries. For EU and Euro Area, only the current and the previous version of the aggregates are published, currently EU-27, EU-25, EA-16 and EA-15. Moreover, data is shown for the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA); in the regional demography domain, an aggregate for the current candidate countries is also available.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/demo_pop_esms.htm",
