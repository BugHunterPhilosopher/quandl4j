      "description": "The Balance of Payments (BoP) systematically summarizes all economic transactions between the residents and the non-residents of a country or of a  economic area during a given period.\r\nThe Balance of payments provides harmonized information on international transactions which are part of the current account (goods, services, income, current transfers), but also on transactions which fall in the capital and the financial account.\r\nBoP is an important macro-economic indicator used to assess the position of an economy (of credit or debit) towards the external world. Data on International Trade in Services (ITS), a component of BoP current account, are used, alongside with data on Foreign Direct Investment, to monitor the external commercial performance of different economies. Out of BoP data, some indicators of EU market integration are also derived.\r\nData are in millions of Euro/ECU.\r\nSeveral statistical adjustments are applied to the original data provided by the Member States. These are described in the International Trade in Services EU 1992-2001 - Compilation guide.\r\nThe International Monetary Fund Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) classification is used for the compilation of the BoP.\r\nThe BoP data are collected through national surveys and administrative sources.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/bop_its_esms.htm",
