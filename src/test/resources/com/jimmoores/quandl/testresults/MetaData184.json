      "description": "The bus serv collection contains harmonised statistics on business services. The statistics on enterprise turnover by product permits analyses on each product's relative importance in the turnover, consistency of product level statistics and product specialisation. On the other hand, information on enterprise turnover by client enables analyses on type and location of client and client specialisation. The economic variables make it possible to extend the analysis to productivity and personnel cost issues.\r\nThe bus serv collection includes the following variables:\r\nnumber of enterprises \r\nturnover or gross premium written\r\nnumber of employees \r\npersonnel costs\r\nvalue added at factor costs\r\nThe turnover variable is broken down by product and type and residence of client. In addition, there is information on the turnover shares of product and client specialised enterprises.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/bs_esms.htm",

      "description": "Data given in this domain are collected by the National Statistical Institutes or Ministries and are based on Eurostat's annual model surveys on ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) usage and e-commerce in enterprises and ICT usage in households and by individuals.\r\nLarge part of the data collected is used in the context of the 2011 - 2015 benchmarking framework (endorsed by i2010 High Level Group in November 2009) and for the Digital Agenda, Europe's strategy for a flourishing digital economy by 2020. This conceptual framework follows the i2010 Benchmarking Framework which itself followed-up the eEurope 2005 Action Plan.\r\nSome data for the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and Korea have been supplied via the OECD (or coming from other sources which are given) in ratio format with no validation by Eurostat.\r\nThe aim of the European ICT surveys is to collect and disseminate harmonised and comparable information on the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals and in enterprises at European level. Data for this collection are supplied directly from the surveys with no separate treatment.\r\nICT USAGE IN ENTERPRISES\r\nThe aim of this survey is the timely provision of statistics on enterprises and the information society. This module provides a framework for the requirements in terms of coverage, duration and periodicity, subjects covered, breakdowns of data provision and any necessary pilot studies.This survey covers enterprises having their main economic activity in NACE sections as specified under section 3.3 \"Sector Coverage\" below.\r\nCoverage:\r\nThe characteristics to be provided for the benchmarking are drawn from the following list of subjects:- development of broadband,- security (special module in 2010),- skills (special module in 2007),- e-business (special module in 2008),- e-commerce (special module in 2009),- adoption of ICT by businesses,- impact of adoption of ICT by businesses,- public services (special module in 2011).\r\nBreakdowns:\r\n- by size class,- by NACE categories,- by region (until 2010)\r\nICT USAGE IN HOUSEHOLDS AND BY INDIVIDUALS\r\nThe aim of this survey is the timely provision of statistics on individuals, households and the information society. This module provides a framework for the requirements in terms of coverage, duration and periodicity, subjects covered, breakdowns of data provision and any necessary pilot studies.\r\nCoverage:\r\nThe characteristics to be provided for the benchmarking are drawn from the following list of subjects:\r\n- developments of broadband,- advanced services, - skills and digital literacy (special module in 2007 and 2011),- e-commerce and trust, - security (special module in 2011),- inclusion,- public services.\r\n\r\nBreakdowns: Relating to households:- by region of residence (optional: NUTS 2)- by geographical location- by degree of urbanisation- by type of household- by households net monthly income (optional)\r\nRelating to individuals:- by region of residence (optional: NUTS 2)- by geographical location- by degree of urbanisation- by gender- by country of birth, country of citizenship (as of 2010, optional in 2010)- by educational level- by occupation- by employment situation- by age (in completed years and by groups)- legal / de facto marital status (as of 2011, optional)\r\n\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/isoc_pi_esms.htm",
