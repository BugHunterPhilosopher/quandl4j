Data for transport of goods in containers are also expressed in volume terms (TEUs = 20 ft equivalent unit).\r\nData at regional level (NUTS 2, 1 and 0) are also available.\r\nThe data collection is based on the terms of Directive 2009/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods and passengers by sea.\r\nThe maritime transport data have been calculated using data collected at port level. The data are displayed at port level, Regional level, Maritime Coastal Area (MCA) level and country level.\r\nThe data are presented in six collections, displaying Main Annual results, Short Sea Shipping, Passengers, Goods, Vessels traffic and Regional information.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/mar_esms.htm",
