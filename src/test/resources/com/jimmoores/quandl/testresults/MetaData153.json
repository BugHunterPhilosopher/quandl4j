      "description": "CVTS2 and CVTS3 data were collected with reference year 1 1999 and 2005 and published by Eurostat in order to:\r\nProvide the Commission with harmonised, reliable and relevant statistical information needed to define, implement, monitor and evaluate Commission policies in the continuing vocational training in enterprises sector.\r\nProvide the EU institutions, national administrations, enterprises, professional associations and EU citizens with high quality statistical services and products in the field of training.\r\nCVTS3 provides comparable statistics on training enterprises, the participation to training, the volume of CVT courses and its costs, and moreover information on Initial vocational training (IVT) courses.\r\nCVTS2 provides comparable statistical results on training and non-training enterprises, the supply of and the demand for vocational skills, the need for CVT and the forms, content and volume of CVT, the use of enterprises' own training resources and of external providers, and the cost of CVT courses.\r\nThe CVTS1 was the first survey on continuing vocational training in enterprises carried out on the EU level in a co-ordinated form (outline questionnaire, common definitions, and common recommendations with the respect to the fieldwork). The survey therefore was of pioneering nature, and is not any longer disseminated.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/trng_cvts_esms.htm",

      "description": "The Bologna declaration was signed in 1999 by 29 European ministers responsible for higher education. Today, 46 signatory countries are engaged in the process towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental initiative which also involves the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO-CEPES, as well as representatives of higher education institutions, students, staff, employers and quality assurance agencies. It aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010, and to promote the European system of higher education worldwide. More information on the Bologna process is available on http://ec.europa.eu/education/higher-education/doc1290_en.htm.\r\nBologna indicators on tertiary education attainment, occupational mismatch and unemployment are based for most of the countries on the results of the European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). For some countries not participating in the EU-LFS data collection, data were provided by their NSI and rely upon national household surveys.\r\n \r\nThe EU-LFS is a quarterly household sample survey carried out in the Member States of the European Union, Candidate Countries and EFTA countries (except for Liechtenstein). It is the main source of information about the situation and trends on the labour market in the European Union. The EU-LFS is organised in 12 modules covering demographic background, labour status, employment characteristics of the main job, atypical work, working time, employment characteristics of the second job, previous work experience of persons not in employment, search for employment, main labour status, education and training, situation one year before the survey and income.\r\nThe survey's target population consists of all persons in private households, although the variables related to labour market are only collected for persons aged 15 years or older.\r\nFor details see Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 of 9 March 1998 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community (OJ No L 77/3).\r\nSince 1999 an inherent part of the European Union EU-LFS are the so called 'ad-hoc modules'.\r\nDetailed information regarding the survey methods, organization and comparability issues is available on the EU-LFS webpage.\r\nThe following datasets are available with indicators on tertiary education attainment, occupational mismatch and unemployment used for the monitoring of the Bologna Process namely on effective outcomes and employability:\r\neduc_bo_ou_att: Population with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), by sex and age\r\neduc_bo_ou_attf: Population with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) aged 25-39, by field of study and sex\r\neduc_bo_ou_ured: Unemployment rate of people aged 20-34, by sex and educational attainment\r\neduc_bo_ou_ursy: Unemployment rate of people with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) aged 20-34, by sex and number of years since graduation\r\neduc_bo_ou_urfi: Unemployment rate of people with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), by field of study and age\r\neduc_bo_ou_mism: People with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) aged 25-34 and employed in ISCO 1 or 2, in ISCO3, and not in ISCO 1|2|3, by sex\r\neduc_bo_ou_mifi: People aged 25-34 with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) being vertically mismatched, by field of study and sex\r\nAs regards some countries, data on tertiary education attainment, occupational mismatch and unemployment were provided outside the framework of the LFS data collection and therefore cannot be considered to be always fully comparable due to differences in the underlying data sources and definitions. This parallel collection was carried out in January 2009 with some Bologna countries that have not participated in the EU-LFS data collection. Data, as well as some metadata, were collected in Armenia (AM), Moldova (MD), Serbia (RS) and Russia (RU):\r\nArmenia (AM): (indicators educ_bo_ou_att, educ_bo_ou_ured). Data provided by the National Statistical Service. Surveys: \"LFS\" and \"ILCS\". LFS for 2007 has been conducted within the frame of ILCS with a reduced number of questions;\r\nMoldova (MD): (indicators educ_bo_ou_att, educ_bo_ou_ured, educ_bo_ou_mism). Data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics. Survey: \"LFS\";\r\nSerbia (RS): (indicators educ_bo_ou_att, educ_bo_ou_attf, educ_bo_ou_ured, educ_bo_ou_ursy, educ_bo_ou_urfi, educ_bo_ou_mism). Data provided by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia. Survey: \"LFS\";\r\nRussia (RU): (indicators educ_bo_ou_urgaed, educ_bo_ou_mism).

      "description": "The source for the regional labour market information down to NUTS level 2 is the EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). This is a quarterly household sample survey conducted in all 27 Member States of the EU and in EFTA and Candidate countries. \r\nThe EU LFS survey follows the definitions and recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). To achieve further harmonisation, the Member States also adhere to common principles when formulating questionnaires. The LFS' target population is made up of all persons in private households aged 15 and over. For more information see the EU Labour Force Survey (lfsi_esms, see paragraph 21.1.). \r\nThe EU-LFS is designed to give accurate quarterly information at national level as well as annual information at NUTS 2 regional level and the compilation of these figures is well specified in the regulation. Microdata including the NUTS 2 level codes are provided by all the participating countries with a good degree of geographical comparability, which allows the production and dissemination of a complete set of comparable indicators for this territorial level.\r\nAt present the transmission of LFS data at NUTS 3 level has no legal basis. However many countries transmit NUTS 3 figures to Eurostat on a voluntary basis, under the understanding that they are not for publication with such detail, but for aggregation in few categories per country, i.e., metropolitan regions and urban -rural typology. Most of the NUTS 3 data are based on the LFS, however, some countries transmit data based on registers, administrative data, small area estimation and other reliable sources.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/reg_lmk_esms.htm",

      "description": "Patent ownership information reflects ownership at the time of patent grant and does not include subsequent changes in ownership. If more than one assignee (owner entity) was declared at the time of grant, the patent is attributed to the first-named assignee. The U.S. and Foreign Corporations ownership categories count predominantly corporate patents; however, patents assigned to other organizations such as small businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, etc. are also included in this category. While U.S. Government patent ownership includes only patents granted to the Federal Government, no such distinction is made for Foreign Government ownership patents. Please note that U.S. origin patents may have foreign category ownership and that foreign origin patents may have U.S. category ownership. Therefore, the patents having U.S.category ownership (or foreign category ownership) do not necessarily correspond to the patents having U.S. origin (or foreign origin) and the sum of U.S. category ownership patents (or foreign category ownership patents) will not equal the sum of U.S. origin patents (or foreign origin patents).",

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.",
