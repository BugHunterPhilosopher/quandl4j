      "description": "Data show environmental protection expenditure (EPE). Environmental protection includes all activities directly aimed at the prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution or any other degradation of the environment. Data on EPE are collected from the European countries every 2 years since 1996 through the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire on Environmental Protection Expenditure and Revenues (JQ-EPER) based on a Gentlemen's Agreement.\r\nThe scope of environmental protection is defined according to the Classification of Environmental Protection Activities (CEPA 2000), which distinguishes nine environmental domains: protection of ambient air and climate; wastewater management; waste management; protection and remediation of soil, groundwater and surface water; noise and vibration abatement; protection of biodiversity and landscape; protection against radiation; research and development and other environmental protection activities.\r\nThe data cover four economic sectors (public sector, business sector, specialised producers and households), several economic variables (total expenditure, total investments, pollution treatment investments, pollution prevention investments, total current expenditure, internal current expenditure, fees and purchases, receipts from by-products, subsidies/transfers and revenues) and the nine environmental domains mentioned above.\r\nData are collected and published in NACE Rev. 1.1 classification for years 1990-2009 and in NACE Rev. 2 for years from 2006 onwards.\r\nAfter collection and validation of the data from Member States, Eurostat calculates EU aggregates for the main variables and the main environmental domains. Data reported by some Member States are incomplete in terms of years, sectors or variables covered and there are also a few Member States which do not yet report any EPE data. Therefore, Eurostat uses a modelling approach to gap-fill missing data and produce estimates of EU aggregates by summing up the gap-filled country data.\r\nEurostat estimates missing data for a specific year, taking into account figures reported in the recent past by the Member State, auxiliary official statistics such as national accounts and government finance data as well as the information conveyed in the data reported by the other Member States for that year.\r\nEurostat estimates are currently published only in NACE Rev. 1.1 data set both at EU and at country level, however the estimated figures presented at country level are strictly considered as Eurostat estimates and not official country data.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/env_ac_exp2_esms.htm",
