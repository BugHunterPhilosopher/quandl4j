      "description": "Structural business statistics on credit institutions are harmonised statistics on the structure, activity, performance and competitiveness of credit institutions. Credit institutions are defined in Article 1 of the Council Directive 77/780/EEC: 'credit institution means an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credits for its own account'.\r\nCredit institutions are normally authorised and registered by the national central banks or by the competent national financial supervisory authority. In the frame of prudential supervision the credit institutions concerned are obliged to submit comprehensive sets of data to the supervisory authorities. The structural business statistics on credit institutions are to a large extent based on this information.\r\nThe Credstat collection includes:\r\ndemographic statistics (number of enterprises (+breakdowns), number of local units, number of branches, etc.), \r\naccounting variables,\r\nvariables by product,\r\nvariables on internationalisation,\r\nvariables on employment,\r\nregional statistics\r\n\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/sbs_cre_esms.htm",

      "description": "An ad hoc module on \"Work-related health problems and accidental injuries\" was included in the 1999 Labour Force Survey (LFS), in order to act as a complementary data source to ESAW (European Statistics on accidents at Work) and EODS (European Occupational Diseases Statistics) and give a broader view on Health and Safety at Work..\r\nThis module provided complementary information on accidents occurring at work and resulting in less than 4 days' absence from work, on return to work after the accident at work and on health problems caused or made worse by work.\r\nThe data refer to self-reported accidental injuries at work during a 12 month period before the survey and to self-reported non-accidental health problems caused or made worse by work and from which the respondent had suffered during a 12 month period before the survey.\r\nThe indicators used for accidental injuries are the percentage distributions of accidents and the relative incidence rate of accidents (relative to the rate in the total of all participating countries, which is marked with 100). The incidence rate is the number of accidents at work per 100 000 employed workers.\r\nThe indicators used for non-accidental health problems are the percentage distribution, number, prevalence rate and relative prevalence rate of health problems (relative to the rate in the total of all participating countries, which is marked with 100). The prevalence rate is the number of people suffering from the health problem during the last 12 months per 100 000 employed workers (see the link to summary methodology at the bottom of the page).\r\nStatistical adjustments:\r\nBecause the frequency of work accidents is higher in some branches (high-risk sectors), an adjustment is performed to get more standardised incidence rates. Similarly, the prevalence rates for non-accidental health problems are standardised for economic activity and for age, as age influences importantly the prevalence of health problems. For more details, please see the link to the summary methodology at the bottom of the page.\r\nGeographical coverage:\r\nDenmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, United Kingdom.\r\nSector coverage:\r\nAll sectors of economic activity are covered. The specification of sectors is given according to the NACE classification (NACE = Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne).\r\nThe incidence and prevalence rates are calculated for the total of all branches.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/hsw_inj_pb_esms.htm",

EW-MFA covers all solid, gaseous, and liquid materials, except for water and air. Water included in products is included.\r\nIn EW-MFA two types of material flows across system boundaries are relevant:\r\nMaterial flows between the national economy and the natural environment: this consists of the extraction of primary (i.e., raw, crude or virgin) materials from and the discharge of materials to the natural environment;\r\nMaterial flows between the national economy and other national economies. This encompasses imports and exports. Only flows that cross the system boundary on the input-side or on the output-side are counted. Material flows within the economy are not represented in EW-MFA. \r\nEW-MFA are meta-compilations of data from various official statistics, most of which are regularly provided and updated by national statistical offices. It is mainly based on data from agricultural, forestry, fishery production, mining, and energy statistics. Import and export data are typically taken from foreign trade statistics although some countries use national accounts as the primary data source for the trade data.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/env_ac_mfa_esms.htm",
