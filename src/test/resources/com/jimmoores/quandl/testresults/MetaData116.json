      "description": "The Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA) provide detailed information on income in the agricultural sector. The purpose is to analyse the production process of the agricultural industry and the primary income generated by this production. The accounts are therefore based on the industry concept.\r\nThe EAA accounts are detailed data on value of output (producer prices and basic prices), intermediate consumption, subsidies and taxes, consumption of fixed capital, rent and interests, capital formation etc. The values are in current as well as in constant prices.\r\nAgricultural Labour Input (ALI) and Unit Values (UV) are an integrated part of the overall concept of Economic Accounts for Agriculture.\r\nEAA accounts are also compiled at regional level (NUTS2), but only in values in current prices. The labour input data and Unit values are not broken down to regional level.\r\nThe Economic accounts for agriculture (EAA) are a satellite account of the European System of Accounts (ESA95), providing complementary information and concepts adapted to the particular nature of the agricultural industry. Although their structure very closely matches that of the national accounts, their compilation requires the formulation of appropriate rules and methods.\r\nNational Statistical Institutes or Ministries of Agriculture are responsible for data collection and calculation of national EAA, in accordance with EC Regulations. Eurostat is responsible for the EU aggregations.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/aact_esms.htm",
