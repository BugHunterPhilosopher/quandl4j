Data on International Trade in Services (ITS), a component of BoP current account, are used, alongside with data on Foreign Direct Investment, to monitor the external commercial performance of different economies. Out of BoP data, some indicators of EU market integration are also derived.\r\nData are in millions of Euro/ECU.\r\nSeveral statistical adjustments are applied to the original data provided by the Member States. These are described in the International Trade in Services EU 1992-2001 - Compilation guide.\r\nThe International Monetary Fund Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) classification is used for the compilation of the BoP.\r\nThe BoP data are collected through national surveys and administrative sources.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/bop_its_esms.htm",
