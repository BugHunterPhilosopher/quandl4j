Part of the data collected is used in the context of the i2010 initiative, which seeks to further boost efficiency throughout the economy through wider use of ICTs. A list of benchmarking indicators has been defined and set out in the i2010 Benchmarking Framework endorsed by the i2010 High Level Group in April 2006. This initiative is a follow-up of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan.\r\nThe aim of the European ICT surveys is to collect and disseminate harmonised and comparable information on the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals and in enterprises at European level. Data for this collection are supplied directly from the surveys with no separate treatment.\r\nRegional data have been reported by a number of countries for the following indicators:\r\nHouseholds with access to the Internet at home\r\nHouseholds with broadband connection\r\nIndividuals regularly using the Internet\r\nIndividuals who have never used a computer\r\nIndividuals who ordered goods or services over the Internet for private use\r\n2007 - UK - UKM6: The Scottish Highlands and Islands were not in the sampling frame for the Omnibus survey, so all the variables for this optional breakdown are unavailable.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/isoc_reg_esms.htm",
