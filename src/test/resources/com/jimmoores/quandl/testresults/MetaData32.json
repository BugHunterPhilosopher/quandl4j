Part of the data collected is used in the context of the eEurope i2010 initiative, which seeks to further boost efficiency throughout the economy through wider use of ICTs. As a follow-up of the 2005 Action Plan a list of benchmarking indicators has been defined in the i2010 High Level Group Benchmarking Framework.\r\nThe aim of the European ICT surveys is to collect and disseminate harmonised and comparable information on the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals and in enterprises at European level. Data for this collection are supplied directly from the surveys with no separate treatment.\r\nICT usage in enterprises \r\nThe aim of this survey is the timely provision of statistics on enterprises and the information society.
