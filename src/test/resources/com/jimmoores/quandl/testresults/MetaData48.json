Domestic money banks comprise commercial banks and other financial institutions that accept transferable deposits, such as demand deposits.  Private credit by deposit money banks and other financial institutions to GDP, calculated using the following deflation method: {(0.5)*[Ft/P_et + Ft-1/P_et-1]}/[GDPt/P_at] where F is credit to the private sector, P_e is end-of period CPI, and P_a is average annual CPI. Raw data are from the electronic version of the IMF's International Financial Statistics.
