      "description": "The PSE index series consists of the PSEi, six sector indices and the All Shares Index. The base level of the PSEi was pegged at 1,022.045 points. This was reckoned according to the close of the index on February 28, 1990, which is the PSEi base date. With the exception of the All Shares Index, all these indices are free float-adjusted. The PSE Index Series is calculated in Philippine Pesos (Php). The PSEi is the main index of the Exchange. It is composed of a fixed basket of 30 companies, whose selection is based on a specific set of criteria. The PSE also maintains six sector indices representing each major sector under the revised industry classification of the Exchange. These indices are the (1) Financials Index; (2) Industrial Index; (3) Holding Firms Index; (4) Property Index; (5) Services Index; and (6) Mining & Oil Index.
