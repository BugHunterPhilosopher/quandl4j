In practice, it typically holds all 500 of the stocks in the S&P 500Â® Index, which is a capitalization-weighted index that measures the performance of the large-capitalization sector of the U.S. stock market. The fund is managed through the use of a 'quantitative' or 'indexing' investment approach, which tries to replicate the composition and performance of the S&P 500Â® Index through statistical procedures.",
